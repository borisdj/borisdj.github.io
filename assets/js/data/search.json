One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be educated about it and have an informed opinion. They also increase cooperativeness, a useful trait of human species.  Next to mention that taxes enable society to function at large, to manage shared resources and cover the costs. Some things can not be built and used individually, it is not practical nor efficient, because of scale and logistics. This includes public infrastructure, such as roads and city installations for water and electricity, that have natural monopolistic structure. In some cases also includes hospitals and schools assuming there are public ones. Additionally, there are costs of maintaining those facilities and institutions.   Civic society organizes itself as a country of citizens or a nation state. Always remember that the function of all Government Services is to serve the people and community, and never forget that politicians are your employees (servants) and not masters.  Next important issue is the level of taxes and their complexity, as well as how they are implemented and controlled/enforced. Firstly, it obviously can’t be either 0 nor 100%. Secondly, some consider it reasonable to have tax rates in the range between 10% and 50%. 10% or 1/10 (one tenth) was often a historic norm in the past. The 50% or 50/50 model is a common concept of fairness. Higher than half could be counterproductive as most people would be discouraged to work when the state takes too much or their earnings (motivation and incentive matters), and also it becomes prohibitive on economic growth. Even good intent, if not set properly, could lead to negative outcomes (the road to hell is paved with good intentions). Many socialist revolutions ended with economic collapse and failed spectacularly. Still, ethical considerations of redistributive taxation includes viewing it as morally virtuous to reduce extreme inequality and provide a safety net (Kant’s categorical imperative and justification / tax-justice).  In conclusion, up to 50% is considered by many conservative economists as Fair and socially optimal rate for balancing growth, equity, and incentives (even top marginal tax rates should not exceed 50%). Furthermore, individual responsibility of each citizen could mean having a moral duty to contribute to society and civilization.  More central stance would be to have majority of incomes taxed in ranges between 20% and 40% or 42% as an answer to the Ultimate Question of Tax (European OECD countries in 2025 have 42 avg. top marginal rate). Effective rate of around 20% could cover approximately 80% of people - in line with Pareto Principle 80/20 rule (Distribution of Taxes paid by Income Groups). Different countries, depending on culture and economic development, could have different limits, or Tiers so to say. These would be some general guidelines. For determining rates and tiers or band limits it should be looked into the public record of Income Statistics. It might take a few iterations to fine-tune them, just always start from first principles and keep critical thinking. It should always be kept in mind that the proportion of the budget with total public spending in a fiscal year and of GDP should not exceed a ratio of 30 to a maximum of 40%. During implementation of changes, it can be decided whether to aim for revenue neutrality to target slight increase, depending on previously mentioned ratio. Also, a phased pilot approach would be useful for enhancing the feasibility of a project.  Another issue with too high taxes is that people stop paying it and start actively working to avoid them - The Laffer Curve (optimal tax rate that maximizes state revenue). Some even think it could be as high as 70%, but that would be very unpopular and probably not socially acceptable, and also has some negative externalities with unintended consequences.  Also important to know why all of this was not already done, practical justification was that the rich would leave and another based on principle was that taking someone’s money is immoral. But if taxes are moderate and spent wisely, it would refute the criticisms. What remains is the real reason behind this, is that rich people have power and influence over the media, hire clever accountants who know how to find and use tax loopholes and are lobbying politicians.Progressive model  In general, the tax model should be Progressive (how good is it), with a higher rate for higher income, but still having a maximum limit to be widely acceptable (having precise Highest and Lowest Bracket). It was designed more than 200 years ago and is already in effect world wide in many countries, especially in more developed economies. It represents an excellent way to smooth the tax cliff edge, that should be avoided at all costs, as it disincentivizes growth.One could ask why such a model, a few reasons (why are fair):-1. philosophical argument emphasising humanism/humanity (civilizational progress &amp; taxation renaissance),-2. better social cohesion and harmony based on adequate social contract, less strain on societal fabric,-3. enables a more productive population, in other words, healthy and well educated and satisfied people are more fruitful, while those under constant stress lose creativity and fear taking even small risks,-4. based on ‘ability to pay’ principle, meaning heaviest burden carried on the strongest shoulders (taxation equitable across income groups); but also ‘benefit’ principle - paid the most by those who benefit the most (more assets has a greater need of police, fire-department, etc)-5. the marginal utility of money drops off the higher it gets, so a flat tax would be less fair because the burden is unequal.  Reducing inequality also reduces social division and tensions (less group friction and conflict) with more economic mobility due to real and effective equality of opportunity (where each person is then responsible for the outcome). The fact that one must look after themselves, doesn’t mean he can’t care about others, it is not mutually exclusive, just need the right balance. This would also lead to a happier population that could partially help with solving some of the pressing issues, like the housing crisis and low birth rates, although the latter is more of a cultural and psychological issue of modern parents. People have strong tendencies to compare themselves with their peers and current circumstances, and not with their predecessors or older generations nor how things were in the past (social comparison theory). Even if on average most people are objectively much better off than ever before in history, it wouldn’t matter, most will only care about what others have and do today, and digital social media only exacerbate the problem (‘get rich or die trying’). Partly because of that in today’s world having kids and also raising them into decent persons and productive members of society should be considered as one of important accomplishments in life and be commendable.  In a political-economic sense this would be a standard capitalist system with a moderate level of social democracy mixed with liberal democracy (social liberalism). History shows that this is most stable in the long run, and the least bad we know so far, while keeping as much individual freedom as possible. Somewhat similar to the Nordic model, mixture of a free market with less regulation. But with a strong welfare state, and labor market regulated by negotiations between labor unions and employer unions, where applicable. Another characteristic of this model is ‘Flexicurity’, relaxed hiring and firing regulations combined with strong social safety nets through government grants and social insurance.  Still, this model is not easily replicable in other countries (welfare hard to copy), due to different culture and internal solidarity, but also a fact that they are economically highly developed nation, have small population with relatively high income average. Nevertheless, one can be inspired by aspects of the nordic model and strive in that direction by implementing some elements to a certain level. One good example would be universal state-sponsored healthcare as market mechanisms here might not lead to efficiency, since sick people and in distress can not evaluate the quality of medical services, nor easily compare different hospitals. If compared to the US where it is more expensive but less effective, because of a largely private, for-profit system with a complex insurance structure leading to higher administrative costs and drug prices (denmark healthcare better with less money). America is one of few developed nations with declining life expectancy in recent years. Interesting hybrid model is the Swiss healthcare structure as a decentralized, universal system funded by a combination of taxes, mandatory private health insurance from non-profit insurers and out-of-pocket payments. Swiss have high-quality medical services and advanced technology.  When it comes to maternity leave, the US for example has a very bad record with only 3 months of leave and even that is not a universal benefit. Europe in this regard is much better with around 12 months of parental allowance. And it would be best to extend paid parental leave a few months more to 16, the last 4 divided equally between both parents for better bonding with the child. After that there could be subsidies for daycare or kindergarten in line with market prices until starting going to school.For estimating all potential effects, check the Income Distribution in a form of very useful visual graph below.In the US bottom 20% of people earn up to 24 000 $ / year, while top 20% earners are above 100 K or even 120 000 $ annually as of 2025.Distribution of Global Wealth - in 2021 and change 2000-2023:(source: visualcap/wealth21 &amp; visualcap/change20-23, also dataisbeautiful/wealth-range)Tax typesTaxes could be grouped into 3 categories, based on either earning, buying or owning.Tax types mostly in effect are: 1. Income, 2. Capital gains, 3. Corporate, 4. VAT, 5. Inheritance, 6. Wealth.  Focus will be on Personal Income tax and Capital Gains tax as they are direct and most important. Individual Income from labour but also from Dividends - US_Div (Ordinary or Qualified) and UK_Div with rates not quite the same as income rates, and it would be desirable to make all incomes equal (a singular tax model on income from any source). Bear in mind that for dividends that are paid to shareholders, the company already had to pay corporate tax on declared profit, but it is somewhat passive income so it can be considered acceptable. Fair amount of analysis was done on US and UK sample, since they have a long record of stable economy, and also developed tax system, but still have a lot of problems (TaxPolicyCenter: compare US internationally).  All tax related things should be Simple as possible in line with the KISS principle (elegance of simplistic design). Also there should be minimal difference between Income and Capital Tax, so that there is no distortion of either segment. This in practice could mean that tax tiers in both categories should be similar, while Social and Pension and Medical insurance should have max limit on mandatory part, with anything above to be optional. More precisely, basic health contributions should be the same for everyone and health fund to have 30% additional support from taxes. While pension contributions can be proportional, larger payment means larger pension, and with 2 pillars (second by choice over mandatory amount).  On the technical side, tax rules should be simple, and percentages to be round numbers with only a few incremental steps like +- 2% or 5%. There should exist several standardized tiers, for societies with different stages of development, that also could have specific culture and history.(1) Income Tax (salary/wage and personal income)Brackets and increments example - to better understand concept (functional beauty in numerical math symmetry): № From To Amount Step Model XS Model S Model M Model L Model XL 1 0 10 000 10 K 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 2 10 000 20 000 10 K 10 % 10 % 10 % 10 % 10 % 3 20 000 50 000 30 K 15 % 20 % 20 % 20 % 20 % 4 50 000 100 000 50 K 20 % 25 % 30 % 30 % 30 % 5 100 000 500 000 400 K 25 % 30 % 35 % 40 % 40 % 6 500 000 no limit - 30 % 35 % 40 % 45 % 50 % -Tax Models: (X-Extra); S - Small, M - Medium, L - Large (M as the Golden Mean - politically most doable)-First 10 K (around half of full time minimum pay) is tax free in all models.-Represented as US yearly average $ value, should be scaled to each country based on their GDP per capita and/or median wage and specific currency.-Another option is 8 brackets with 2 more rows: 200 000 i 1 000 000 with symmetry 1 2 5 (tab SCALE8 on sheet below), or to go with just 4 brackets 0/10/50/150 K (tab SCALE4). -Due to inflation, caused by money devaluation, ranges From-To should be periodically updated and rounded, like every 5 years or so (do the Indexation). Good practice can be to choose new thresholds that are divisible by 12 months.-It would be applicable only to residents, those with tax residency which usually means being in a country for more than half a year - 183 day rule. However, some like the USA impose taxes on all citizens, even those living abroad. This is something they can do because of their current, some would now say previous, dominance in the economic, military and political spheres.Data examples and comparative analysis of models - Tax Codex data sheet - tab SCALE:(can be copied on Google-Drive to do further examination and customization){Brackets can be divisible by 12 (12/24/48/96/480 K - SCALE-12M), to get rounded numbers for monthly thresholds}* asymptotically approaching top marginal tax rate at highest income levelsFor example, with gross income of 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 K total Yearly Tax and Effective Rate in model M are: Gross Tax Calculation Yearly Tax Eff.rate US.. / UK.. 20 K 10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 1,000 5% 5% / _7% 30 K 10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 + 10K * 0.2 3,000 10% 7% / 11% 60 K 10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 + 30K * 0.2 + 10K * 0.30 10,000 16% 12% / 19% 120 K 10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 + 30K * 0.2 + 50K * 0.30 + 20K * 0.35 29,000 24% 17% / 30% 180 K 10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 + 30K * 0.2 + 50K * 0.30 + 80K * 0.35 50,000 28% 20% / 35% 240 K 10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 + 30K * 0.2 + 50K * 0.30 +140K* 0.35 71,000 30% 22% / 37% Tab CHART has sample of progressive chart, drawing with cells on digi graph paper:  One rule of thumb, based on common sense, would be to have less developed countries start with models that have lower taxes, and then every decade to aim for a higher model until it comes to optimal range. Changes should be gradual, step-by-step movement, to have smooth transition. For example in Denmark the top tier is 56%, which is above both median and upper line, but it still seems to work fine in their society, as they remain a country with high Happiness Score. So the remarkable thing is widespread acceptance of this very high burden and tax regime. Besides Denmark, several other countries could be taken into consideration for comparison including: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway, UAE, Singapore.  Currently the US has federal income tax with a top marginal rate at 37 %, while in the UK it goes to 45%. As we can see both countries already have progressive tax system where most are paying their fair share when it comes to Income tax, but Capital tax remains somewhat problematic. Tax expenditures (deductions, exemptions, and preferential tax rates) are a major driver of inequality, due to bad tax policy. Changes post 1980s in the US regarding capital gains and dividends were the largest contributor to the increase in the overall wealth imbalance. Hyper-Financialization, referring to the increased dominance and complexity of the financial sector in the economy, has been a significant trend over the past several decades, particularly since the 1980s. Many argue that such excessive Financialization of the entire economy, with control of the financial sector over everything else, is a major driver of rising income and wealth disparity. On top of this, high inflation and ever growing debt are just making the problem even worse, especially since the 2000s with tax breaks and cuts. Essentially, the stock market has become highly speculative with many bubbles, almost gambling alike. High inflation is forcing working people to invest almost all their savings and become traders, but they still lack the time and knowledge, and big market players are extra profiting by taking advantage of this information asymmetry. Even retirees are unknowingly funding those speculative waves, from which fund managers and banks are benefiting the most (small investors pay, banksters play - a Wall Street phrase).  (2) Capital gains - usually have lower rates then Income tax, in order to promote prudent long term investments and ventures. However this is a significant contributor to class stratification as it also works as passive income so much more scalable, in addition to the Cumulative feature of money that is not spent but reInvested. Currently in many jurisdictions long term (longer than 1 year) capital gains tax is mostly around 20% like in the US (bump-zone and cap-gains-25), while for example in France and UK goes up to 30% and 32%. Therefore it might be best to categorise capitals gain like any regular Income and apply the same or similar tax bracket on sum received from both. (YT: why rich don’t pay taxes and how avoid paying)  Relevant issue with gains tax is when a person never sold the shares and usually there were no dividends either, meaning no realised gains. Instead they just take large credits insured by stocks, so called ‘stock-as-collateral tax loophole’, also named ‘buy-borrow-die’ (YT: BBD - The Free Money Loophole and Mother of all loopholes) or ‘buy-borrow-hold’ strategy (BBD explained). Here the interest rate on loan is very low, more than market returns even, and significantly lower then tax rate. For such a situation, legislative consideration should be to have a tax event on realised gains when taking large credit that is secured by stocks and alike. Taxable events could be any time the asset is utilized to receive money from its value. Of course it would only apply over a certain threshold, maybe 1 million, and possible only on stocks as they are transparent and liquid enough (budgetlab/reforming borrowing; equitablegrowth/close borrow hole; taxnotes/no tax-free lunch).  There were even suggestions to go straight to taxing unrealized gains, but it would not be a good nor fair solution and would not work properly so we will disregard it. There is no issue when the founder of a multi million dollar company keeps ownership just to maintain control over it, while giving valuable service and products to the people. On the other hand when he sells it for money that acts as a wider option on all societal resources (change of potential usage), then it is justified to have that be a taxable event. Maybe some compromise could be to have a small tax like 0.4 or 0.5 % for value above 100 million and after 5th year since founding of company but to have it in-kind and in form of preferred stock (non-voting shares) and also put aside in a sovereign fund for at least 10 years.So, simply closing the previously mentioned borrowing loophole would be more than enough. This could reduce the recently established unusual practice of stock buybacks for tax advantages. Since this borrowing closure is still a somewhat unusual proposition, regulation could initially be for a limited period, say 10 years. After that the results would be evaluated, before making it permanent or for a longer period in line with concept law expiration, explained below in more detail. Nevertheless keep a healthy dose of scepticism towards this suggestion, until proven as net positive.  When it comes to real estate, one main property where a person or family lives for more then 2 years ought Not to have Capital gains tax (Private Residence Relief) up to some reasonable limit (0.4M) and size (married couple single property with higher limit like 2.5x). Otherwise it would unnecessarily have bad stimulus on people not to move even when they change job to more distant location. In a high inflation environment, it’s crucial to differentiate between nominal gains (increasing price only) and real gains (increasing purchasing power). Taxes on nominal gains can sometimes distort investment decisions when they don’t reflect true wealth increases (tax rate to infinity). Reason more why we should get rid of inflation as much as possible, making nominal and real gains almost the same. But until then an argument can be made that the top marginal tax rate could be somewhat lower, especially for a longer period (5+ years) with higher inflation.  (3) Corporate tax could also have maybe 3 middle tiers to give support to smaller companies in order to promote healthy competition. Say 2% for small Sole Proprietorship (SP), 10% for smaller firms like startups for the first 2 or 4 years if they have revenue below some threshold like 1 million, and 20% for large corporations (anti-monopoly measure). At the moment, the US corporate tax rate is 21%, while the EU average is almost the same 21.5% but it ranges from 10% to 30%, depending on the specific country, UK has it at 25%. It should not be too high because when using profits to pay out dividends or even doing shares buyback which drives the stock price up, a taxable event would occur eventually. So with progressive taxes on dividend income, it would kinda be taxed twice, but for most people still below 50%, and it is passive income. On the other hand, employee salaries are expens so there is no double taxation there. Also many many large corporations are using different strategies such as foreign subsidiaries, and some loopholes to reduce the effective tax rate they pay. For example Google paid only 7% in 2023, with some paying even zero tax, while many paid on average 10 to 15%.  (4) VAT - Value Added Tax on sales (consumption tax) is also quite important. Most EU countries have it from 18% to 25%, the Swiss having it at around 9%, while the US does Not have any on federal level and instead has Sales tax only in some states at 7 or 8 %. Even the UAE, known for low taxes, has 5% VAT. The US deficit (1.8T) could be cut in half with new 10% Federal VAT that would bring about 1 trillion revenue. Remaining deficit could be resolved with 400 billion from increased revenue of capital gains, while the remaining 400 could be solved with spending cuts, 200 from military budget and 200 from other non constructive areas.  In general, many consider the optimal level for VAT to be between 10% and 20%, with 15% as a middle ground. And it should be paid only on collected receivable with option for monthly or quarterly accounting. Many countries have differential rates based on product category, a reduced one rate of 0 or 5% for basic food, some medicaments and baby equipment. And higher like 25% for luxury and exclusive goods that include special jewelry, expensive watches, high-end fashion, sports cars. For easier implementation and less distortion of market sectors and products, maybe it would be better to have only one rate, and fix the issues on other side with child benefits and maybe separate excise tax for tobacco, and optionally spirit alcohol as well. Besides, those who spend a lot, they probably have high income on which they pay higher tax rates so it is somewhat balanced there in the start. Finally, in order to eliminate any exemptions VAT should be paid also on financial services and banking industry (TaxResearch).  In the future this revenue might even enable some modest version of UBI - Universal Basic Income, or as some call it Freedom/Civic Dividend. Could be especially beneficial with all the technological progress and automatization including robotics and AI. But funding it to be only from regular taxes (‘trickle-up’ economy), not from debt nor money printing. Point is in using existing revenue and allocating it more directly and efficiently with lower administrative overhead. Another approach would be Friedman’s NIT - Negative Income Tax, to reduce complex social insurance schemes and unnecessary cost of bureaucracy while solving poverty. Furthermore, with NIT there is gradual transition of tax level as the ones income rises, instead of sharp benefits cut off that sometimes disincentivizes working.  Combined sum of Vat and Income tax should still in average stay under 50% for most people. To help with solving housing issues, the first house or apartment could be Vat tax-free up to a defined amount, and in addition to have loans subsidized for young couples buying their first home. Also, a significant part of Vat revenue should go Local communities.  (5) Inheritance tax, exists only in several countries where it is levied only above a certain threshold with different percentages. In some places they are referred to as Estate taxes.One example for inheritance is Switzerland where it is not on federal level but cantonal, and applies only above 1 million CHF, and goes from 1 to 7%. On the other hand, the US (above 15 million, or 30 m. for married couple) and UK (above 325 K, or 1 mil. for couples) have a rate up to 40%. UK also has a 7-year Rule under which if inheritance is gifted 7 years prior to person death it is tax free. Personal stance here is that it would be appropriate to be up to 20% for values above 10 million $. When making a decision do note that not many countries have this type of tax, so it is not widely used. Having this tax too high could lead to frivolous and reckless behavior during life with wasteful spending on superficial things - bad version of extravagance. Note that many billionaires plan to leave each child only 10 million usd, in order to not spoil them with laziness. Also any exception, usually creates market distortion like for land of big farmers, which is then used as a loophole for the very rich buying a lot of farmland. So exceptions should be avoided, and make the rule moderate with a large enough threshold, say 1 million.  (6) Wealth tax is hard to enforce and could push people to move to other countries or states, even more so now with mobility of digital capital and wealth stored in cyberspace, and is not worth it (Super-rich leaving Norway or moving from California to Texas). Also, since it was previously accumulated, on which tax was already paid so there is no justification to tax it again every year, just like there is no excuse for taxing money savings with inflation every few months. Especially, since wealth or money will be used/spent in the future, at which point there it will again be probably taxed via VAT. Some countries, Denmark included, even have a small LVT - Land Value Tax (version of Georgism; book review Progress And Poverty by Henry George), from which income goes to local authorities. Similarly, some countries have small real estate tax on value of additional property above some threshold and size on primary residence, ranging from 0.1% to 1%. This revenue usually goes to the municipality (could be used for subsidisation housing loans for young people), and it could somewhat incentivize productive use of land and buildings by having it between 0.1% and 0.5%. Such properties are usually revalued every 2 or 5 years.  Even a small rate of 2% / year (as some are proposing) could end up being counterproductive, since it is not easy to implement nor to properly evaluate all wealth. Say, if a person has 20 million net worth of which 10 mil. is value of his company (privately held asset) where the rate of Return on Equity - ROE is around 8% so 800,000. Remember that there is 40% income tax and a person is left with 480,000. Then with 2% wealth tax being 200,000 the amount remaining would be 280,000 so total tax rate could come to 65% and effectively ROE comes down to just 2.8%. If we were to add Business tax of 15% that company already paid then effective tax becomes 70%. In some other cases with smaller profit like with 5% ROE, effective taxes would be over 80% of profit. That is why this is not a good model. Also, the wealthy are often competitive investors, most are not just sitting on their capital. And if their assets rise in value a lot then unrealised gains would be more sensical, or at least with less bad side effects. And always keep in mind the importance of property rights and personal freedom that the state sometimes infringe upon (Life, Liberty, and Property - fundamental natural rights by philosopher John Locke used in US Declaration of Independence).  Some would levy wealth tax, also known as capital or equity tax, on billionaires, a billion+ net worth individuals, and in the US among 340 million people there are less than 1000 such ultra-wealthy individuals (Forbes richest list and real-time), but I remain sceptical how effective it would be. Another proposal was for a one time tax, which might not have prolonged side effects, but still it could have negative results overall. However, here is one peculiar idea, to tax past the first billion at a rate 1 percent once every two years (1% / 2y, annually rate 0.5%) and put those revenues into a special development fund. The fund in question would be for scientific and technological research, that could include investments in renewable energy (most important resource of future) like better solar panels (perovskite), efficient battery storage (sodium-ion and solid state, green hydrogen production (electrolysis), nuclear fusion (small modular reactors - tokamak).  This should be more than tolerable and would help with extreme wealth concentration. In addition, it could also help increase ownership dispersion of unicorn companies as most of multi-billion wealth is in shares of a companies (allow for in-kind payment to sovereign wealth fund possibly). The condition could be that there is no tax for the first 10 years after establishment if the company has not made a profit in at least 2 years. In addition, an lower rate could optionally be set at a lower threshold, for example 0.1% for over 50 million, while 0.5% remains for over a billion. Effectively, the largest and highest quality potential and productive assets are real estate (land, houses, buildings, etc.) and equities of companies. These 2 types practically make up almost 80% of the important assets that these 2 taxes would cover, but only in an extremely high concentration, and with small percentages. This could collectively provide incentives for extremely large assets to be used productively and profitably and not just sit as dead or insufficiently profitable capital. All of this would force a certain minimum return on large capital.(7) Inflationary tax i.e. direct money creation could be used to reduce indebtedness and thereby the unnecessary high cost of interest on it. When the debt is eliminated or reduced to a sufficient level, then the rate can be reduced or the inflow can be redirected to the development fund.Table types and models № - Code Tax type Threshold Model 1 S Model 2 M Model 3 L Note 1 - INMC Income 6 tiers 0/…/35 % 0/…/40 % 0/…/45 % select and apply 2 - CPTL Capital gains same or : 0/10/25 % 0/15/30 % 0/15/35 % similar tiers 3 - CRPR Corporate 0/100K/1M 0/10/10 % 2/10/15 % 5/10/20 % elaborate 4 - VAT Vat - 10 % 15 % 20 % diff.M2: 5/15/25% 5 - INHR Inheritance 1/10/100 M 0/10/20 % 5/15/25 % 10/20/30 % to consider 6 - WLTH Wealth property &gt;0.5M 0.1 % 0.2 % 0.4 % to Local 0.1-0.5% ******** 7 - INFL Inflation tax cash savings 1% 1.5% 2% money supply Revenue sources based on tax type US vs OECD-Organiz._Econ. CoOperation &amp; Development (TaxFoundation):Taxation Simplification  A simpler tax code means simplification of taxes for everyone. Redact 6000 pages tax code to less then 100 where besides main models additionally keeping only an effective set of deductions, with basic short edition in 10 pages (less chance for a bug aka hole). Also, one good technical facilitation would be to use digitalization and advanced software by tax authorities to create and prepare pre-filled tax forms ready for submission with just email confirmation.  Emphasys should be on sustainability and stability, with balanced budget and long-term planning. That is why this would be considered as a Protocol with standardized rules and the generalization of the tax system (Engineering of taxation - a technical approach to solving complex tax problems). This would make filling digitized reports for the Tax Authority much easier (using API), both for firms and also for accountants. And paying taxes could be made automatically using pre-programmed payments standing orders (tax pay on autopilot). Also as money is becoming ever more digital, payouts from the budget with clear rules could be pre-programmed, hence reducing bureaucracy and inefficiency. Total budget plan could be based on previous year revenue, with some buffer for differences, so no need for imprecise projection. This would eliminate overly optimistic predictions about future growth used as an excuse for excess spending. With all that, even ERP systems could then become more Protocol-like (work in progress) and would have most settings parameterized. This would enable them to be easily configured for any country or any tax type. Excellent combination of Smart Money, Smart Taxes and Smart Business.  Still in the long term, all countries should aim towards more unified ranges, as human values should be universal. It could also make the world more stable, with less issues for tax avoidance using offshore zones and tax havens, also called secrecy jurisdiction. That practice needs to become illegitimate in order to be reduced. If taxes are not too high, then tax avoidance should not be considered an achievement or admirable. Another issue would be fully illegal tax evasion. In the meantime more global coordination would be needed (global minimum tax for businesses of at least 15%), and special inspection of trust funds. Trusts have high legal expenses (lawyer and paperworks) and practically are only available to persons with very high net worth, privilege of the rich or unfair advantage (how trusts avoid taxes). For closing the loopholes it would be best to call upon experts in accounting, finance, and lawyers that have actually worked on creating these schemes, and use their experience to fix it permanently. Also to have a reward if someone finds a hole that could be exploited, similar to how IT systems often has prizes for white hat ethical hackers that discover bugs or security issues and help with patching it (tax holes bounty).  Several last decades we have witnessed higher inflation. Since 1980 total rise in average prices is around 4 times (with average yearly inflation ~3%), while M2 money supply rose 14x (averaging to ~6.2% per year). Difference is due to several factors: technology driven productivity pulling the prices down, dollar a world reserve currency and US exporting inflation, excess money going into properties and stock so average inflation is lower as assets higher. M2 is not perfect proxy for all the money supply, including debt which create money, but it is good enough approximation. It is obvious why discretionary approach to such a sensitive thing is dangerous as it becomes manipulated. So instead of letting this high inflation having very bad effects, it could be better to place strong constraints on money creation.  Thing to have in mind, for future sake, is that if we ever reform the monetary systems to permanently low money inflation (like k-percent rule, say 2%), then currency itself would not rapidly lose value as today. And the treasury could have a reserve fund for crisis situations to still have some monetary influence if needed. In such an environment monetary premium of non productive assets like real estate would reduce greatly, hence capital gain taxes on those would not be significant, instead income from labour and direct capital like dividends, would be more important, as well as revenue from Vat. This would be good as it would make taxation less complicated and easier to implement.Postface  Progressive taxation is key pillar of modern societies. Tax marginal rate limits (e.g. min 10%, max 45%) should be set with constitutional law so that it needs a supermajority (2/3) of parliament for change - using existing legal framework. While in that range different models could be changed with simple majority but this should not become regular practices, only if not absolutely needed. Any change should be publicly discussed and debated, also planned in advance with any effects calculated into a model, so that everybody is prepared and knows what to expect ahead of time. Similar to how Linux, open source operating system, has regular yearly version updates in the same month, an ultimate predictability. Of course, compare Gini coefficient (measure of wealth inequality) before and after reform or any changes.  Another interesting idea is to have this Law, but also other laws and regulation to be on Github, an excellent collaboration platform, that has great visibility, transparent procedure for update, and detailed history of changes - audit info and track record. This was tried in Washington DC with authoritative digital source laws, sort of like The Legal Repository (Git for policymaking and Version control for law). Of course, a solicitor or legal professional could consult IT experts or tech-savvy individuals for advice using such a tool. To add that such systems need to have data backup with local copies regularly on daily bases to 2 separate safe locations (high redundancy). On top of that to have paper copies as well in a secure archive (document vault), with number and version in the header, where each sheet would be one segment so that only those with changes would need replacement.  In addition, laws themself could have conditional expiration (sunset clause or provision), say 50 years (with exception to constitutional laws), after which they should be reviewed, and discarded if obsolete or renewed(confirmed) with optional amendments. This would help to keep regulation smaller and effective, and at the same time gives each generation a direct chance to express their stance and opinion about matters in question.  Lastly, government spending is important as well. The idea that have been spreading lately how fiscal responsibility is absolutely irrelevant is complete nonsense, MMT included. Real economy, as well as resources and production, have natural limits and so does the state budget. Also taxes need to be public and have broad support from citizens. High monetary inflation is the ultimate example of the too big to fail concept, hence politicians can’t be allowed unconstrained access to such powerful and dangerous tool. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, as proven many times by history. Last few decades we all have witnessed ever growing deficits, with debt ballooning (now often over 100% of GDP) and money printing overuse. Even with all that, there are smaller investments in public infrastructure, and growing wealth gaps over the past few decades. This is due to lower taxes, and higher inflation that acts as a regressive tax as wages are sticky and don’t rise as much as prices while fiat currency has no constraints. It is not good when money printing, either direct or indirect, is used significantly to finance regular government operations. Much better and safer way is to have focus on taxes, because they have more checks and breaks with natural limits, can’t surpass 100%, and are more democratic/decentralized, as opposed to centralised and obscure money creating that is also susceptible to manipulation.  Any credit should have such incentives to be used for new investment, and less on everyday expenditures (reduce the Consumerism and its bad effects; and how Creditism replaced Capitalism / are we living in it?). This statement holds equally true for individuals, companies, and countries. Denmark again, even here, stands as a positive example with very little or no deficit accrual, so Danes live better with less, compared to US citizens. Switzerland is another role model, with a decentralized but efficient government that has historically maintained a low deficit. They have a “debt brake”, a constitutional rule that limits government spending to the expected revenue over the course of a normal economic cycle. This rule helps to ensure fiscal stability and prevent excessive debt accumulation. Country constantly paying interest for ever growing debt on money it controls is unnecessary and just bad practice. Overall, at least about 10% of the budget should be allocated for development and investments including new infrastructure projects, not all going to basic consumption. What is needed is accountability in public spending with conventional budget discipline and traditional view of fiscal policy. There are interesting articles and analysis regarding the subject from 2 organisation, one being IFS - Institute for Fiscal Studies and other IEA - Institute of Economic Affairs (Tax and Fiscal Policy) which is more right-wing but one can still filter some useful constructs from there or be better informed on different spectrum of opinions.  As always, one should approach the issues with caution, as public companies over a long time are prone to mismanagement. So either to have multiple strong checks and balances that are independent and separated with mechanisms to ensure they stay as such. Or to have more private sector and contractors, while keeping transparency in public procurement with fair tenders, equal for all participants. Finding and maintaining a delicate balance in such dynamics requires dedication and constant work, as optimal equilibrium is often fragile. Otherwise, it can easily turn into populism in the political domain and crony capitalism on the economic side. If there is too much corruption and misconduct, and if money from the budget is wasted on unproductive things or misallocated, then people would not see the point in paying their “fair share” to society, and would lose trust in institutions.  I would be very cautious with advocating these changes immediately in very corrupt places, first people would need to curtail it to a bearable level, and only then implement tax changes. Start first with the top income tier as they usually have political connections in those locations. Otherwise it would just be misused. Also too much expenditure on the military is not seen as great utility. While if the system is efficient, where for example all children have good schools with more egalitarian chance for success, then not many would oppose a slightly higher taxes. Still, not too high, so that most would pay it willingly, as a reasonable thing to do. They would know it has a good purpose with noble cause, and will benefit them as well (most people have kids, and they go to school). Young generations deserve a level playing field, especially in education. Lastely, one positive way to look at it is that high earners and those with large income are successful in their profession and are also biggest benefactor to society, so philanthropy by default or phrasing it as taxative altruism (legacy through taxation - public display of list with largest contributors). Person could be happy for paying more taxes even with a higher rate, as it means he/she is earning more.  Most ideas and concepts laid previously are not new, just gathered together into compact and comprehensive models, with few new features for modern age. They are collected from history and by examining the best practices from around the world and merged into this policy-oriented manifesto.  Finally, how could these changes be made? Learn as much about the problem and about potential solutions. Everybody can send notes to their political leaders asking them to incorporate this agenda as an active issue that should be worked on. Then in future elections vote for the party or more specifically for individual candidates that align the most with these proposals and support the objectives. This would not be an easy task and could take a longer time, but one should start now and think about future generations. In the end, the majority can vote for what is in their best interest (although often vote against), but also must look after the entire population and to keep the economic wheel working smoothly, have rational approach, although most humans are more rationalizing than fully rational beings). The broader consensus is reached for the selected model, the better. Finding a compromise (sweet spot) amid diverse political ideologies and opposing views requires the majority of people to be pragmatic and to stay optimistic realists. In the end, implementation of this protocol and initiatives for tax reform (one being Tax Policy Associates Think Tank) depends mostly on civic awareness of people and consequently political will of elected representatives, legislators and government officials. Would be for the best if all political candidates had to pass a test of basic understanding of the taxation system. Also one can find many intriguing reports and articles at TheTaxAdvisor as well as with Tax-consulting thinkers.APPENDIX - only on LOCALized postLeave a message: IP comment Form (comments list - firstByAI and sheet for review)List of all referenced LinksInfopedia blog subscription Form - NewsletterSupported by codis.techQR Link to page" }, { "title": "Solution to OpenSource sustainability (SOSs) - cFOSS", "url": "/solution-to-opensource-sustainability/", "categories": "tech", "tags": "OS, OpenSource, Solution, Sustainability", "date": "2024-12-01 01:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "LANG(jezik): Global (en-us) / Local (sr-latn)Short article: medium/cfoss  Open-Source (img) is a great concept and movement and an excellent way to make Software more accessible and usable (check O...", "content": "LANG(jezik): Global (en-us) / Local (sr-latn)Short article: medium/cfoss  Open-Source (img) is a great concept and movement and an excellent way to make Software more accessible and usable (check OS Initiative). It gives everyone better availability for testing, easier debugging and bug fixes. At the same time enables suggestions and improvements with contributions using PR (PullRequest) based on GitHub collaboration. But lately, that model often has its own challenges and problems due to some business practices. Some even say that Open Source is Broken. So the following proposal is an attempt to find a fix.But first to address two major issues:1) Single Person Dependency  The first matter is that even big projects depend mostly on main developer (one man show) or a handful of significant contributors. At the same time software package or program can have several million users, both private and legal entities, and be used in many applications. However, maintenance often becomes time-consuming with very high expectations and practically requires a full-time job.Still, it ends up relying mostly on the enthusiasm and goodwill of the author, since there are never enough donations or financial support from the big companies. Also, paid support usually doesn’t work and is not scalable, while getting a funding like via OpenCollective is always a struggle.  Such dynamics then puts high pressure and burden on the author, leading to Burnout and abandoning the project or he/she becomes unavailable for any reason (including imprisonment).This situation represents a risk to all users since they would lose support with no easy replacement. One well known situation was OpenSSL Heartbleed security bug, and another is log4j vulnerabilities. Also, in the long term issue for consideration is governance framework. In conclusion, it is rational for companies to pay the small fee and fund the maintainer(s), since it is in their own interest to have better insurance for LTS - Long Term Support. Selection/survival is part of software evolution process. If project grows beyond hobby scope of being a hoby it either dies or obtains proper support and funding.2) Corporate Exploitation  The second concern is that large corporations are profiting significantly from much of OS Software while giving back very little or none at all. They take dozens of OSS and encapsulate it into a commercial proprietary app or service, and on top of that some of them make huge incomes. Which is fine as such but there should be a way to have them pay their fair share to the Engineers behind those projects.  Categorical Imperative (moral implications) in this case would be that those who profit the most should give something back from all the value they get with their business in the industry (Pareto Principle in business model). We can’t just consume open source while ignoring the cost, instead everybody should take responsibility and change the work culture toward sustainability, accessibility and auditability.Model Explanation  One constructive idea that is getting traction is to make it mostly free while keeping the source open. ‘Mostly free’ means zero cost for majority (80 to 90%+) of users, such as those with yearly gross revenues below certain limit, like 500 K or $1 million. Essentially, this approach mirrors a Dual Licensing strategy.  I call this cFOSS - conditionally Free and OpenSource Software, relatively permissive license type with loosely enforced funding (custom OpenSource Protocol). Note that this is not like the Source Available (or Public Source) which essentially only allows for code to be read and nothing else, almost meaningless (OS term is important).Instead, Openness is retained with freedom to use the code, modify it and distribute as a dependency.  It enables sustainability (subsidizing alike) and ensures that project can survive in the long term. What’s more, gives good incentives and creates a self-reinforcing positive loop by encouraging users to contribute via ‘code commits’. Additionaly, pricing should be progressive but with simple tiers (based on number of Devs but in groups or some other metric). And even the top tier should not be too expensive, to be easily acceptable cost for such companies and proportional to the value they receive. For example, tiers could be in range from several hundreds to a few thousand for annual subscription, or alternatively to also have an option for perpetual (permanent) license. Regular funding would also make it possible to have a reward model for impactful collaborators. Also when setting prices please avoid amounts like 999 (stay away from psychology of ‘advertising’), instead use rounded numbers, plain 1000 is fine. Finally, you can consider accepting Bitcoin as payment, as it aligns with the principles OpenSource Money (more info in previous blog posts).  One could argue that in the long term, all software will have tendencies (converges) towards becoming open-sourced. The reason being is that cFOSS as business model has several advantages compared to closed source. Those include better distribution, community licenses that push bottom-up adoption, gratis marketing, etc. It is increasingly dominating software development due to its adaptability, security through transparency, and cost-effectiveness. To frame it as: The OS won. For sceptics, to add that criticism without effective solution is neither useful nor justified.  Ultimately we could group Licenses for OS projects into 2 categories, depending on the hardship of maintenance:1) The first group would be fully free (MIT, Apache, BSD etc), the default for smaller projects that do not require significant time and effort. Besides initial development, later would need only occasional updates.2) Second cFOSS type for larger and more complex projects where it becomes a burden to the developer. And if needed they should be encouraged to switch to these types of licenses (path from projects to products). Also code repositories that are from start made in such a manner deserve to be welcomed by the OpenSource community. Of course, in situations where there was a change anyone can fork the last fully free version and continue maintaining on their own, but it is not an easy endeavor.  Also to mention that distinction between ‘Free-Libre’ and ‘Free (of charge) as in beer’ camps (FLOSS and FOSS philosophy) is that first focuses mainly on Freedom but does Not imply no cost in all circumstances (it is not black-and-white).  Another interesting approach is OpenCore which in base has a core project completely free, but some premium features are paid. Personally, I am not a fan of such structure, and prefer to keep it as a single unified project - in line with the KISS principle. However, I wouldn’t mind others using it, as long as the core component is fully functional for more then half of regular use cases. Still, you can always research ideas about OS monetization - best platforms and find curious stories.Some notable examples of projects with cFOSS license type or similar design:– ImageSharp, – MathParser, – QuestPdf, – MediatR;– EFCore.BulkExtensions - personal Flagship library (this blog post grew from the Bulk saga)‘ (Free Community License covers most cases, only companies with $1 million+ revenue yearly need Commercial)More systemic approach, would be to have several Foundations that would collect donations for popular fullyFree projects and even do billing for payed cF licenses from large Companies and then distribute funding to maintainers.Github Sponsors is one example of this model in general but, at the moment, I do not se it having big traction nor significant impact.And in MS ecosystem there is .Net Foundation that should do similar but they ended up doing absolutely nothing (zero funding), existing only as a name on papar.  Finally a Recommendation for everyone would be to find a project that interests them which they also need and use, and could allocate some spare time to it. There is always a need to help with open question, improve documentation and samples, make tests, solve issue, add new functionalities and other ways of contribution. Later if you have a problem/idea make your own fully FOSS, and after a few of those one might become cFOSS or set it up as such from start.  The Rule of thumb could be that 1 in 3 to 5 projects might be significant enough to have cFOSS while others would be fully FOSS (another case of Pareto). There is useful info on opensource : starting-a-project and getting-paid. As for the companies they also can make sure Open-Source tools are safe.License types comparison: Name Type Code public Distribute &amp; Modify Price Examples fFOSS Regular Yes Yes fully Free and permissive MIT, Apache, BSD cFOSS Dual Yes Yes cond.

It also limits the number of transactions per second (TPS), in order to achieve global sync state for consensus. DB size needs to grow at moderate pace in order for many nodes to be able to keep up with storage capacity and internet bandwith.Even if Bitcoin 10 TPS were to be somehow miraculously increased by a factor of 10 without losing security, still 100 TPS would change nothing, since for the entire world we need at least 1 million TPS. Blockchain Trilemma /\\ (resilience vs efficiency):1.Decentralisation, 2.Security, 3.Scalability (No̱ 3 left for next layers).– One of the most promising Solutions is The Lightning Network, developed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja(WhitePaper: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments - 2015/2016).It works via bidirectional channels between nodes, and needs base transactions for opening, closing, rebalancing and routing. But once set up it can handle large volumes of transactions without the need for regular main net connection.Those protocols are meant to extend Bitcoin’s functionality up to a point, while maintaining the base layer secure and decentralized (LN 2.0).– As such it has the potential for over 1 million TPS, just the right number, while keeping the fees low. Still it should be mentioned that this is not necessarily the ultimate fix and still hase some challenges.– Also worth noting is that it is not currently feasible for every person on the planet to have a fully custodial lightning wallet with its own node. With current transaction throughput we could see each year opening up to 100 000 new channels, relatively slow for global population. Instead, a more realistic approach is to have many distributed custodians.– In fact every bank could become custodian and a lightning node (distributed and dispersed hub-and-spoke network architecture). On top of that maybe only few percent of the global population will have self custody, with either completely or partially trustless implementation.– So in the next 20+ years if few billion people, would start using it we could expect around 50 000 nodes with average 100 K users. Of course there would be a small number of ones with million users and also many small ones with few hundreds users - Normal Distribution of banking, as currently there are around 25 000 banks globally. (Mega banks vs Community banks.)– Also it is expected from big corporations to have their own nodes and channels with vendors for payment, while small companies would use custodian banks. Just like large enterprises have their own accounting sector, while smaller ones hire external service from accounting bureaus.– For better understanding a simple analogy is when you open a beer tap with bartender and at the end of night it gets settled with finality. In practice request for payment is send from receiver as Lightning Invoice, that can be with defined amount, or empty and left for sender to enter it. – Another issue that Lighting improves upon is Privacy as transactions are not publicly visible on the chain.LN also adds support for miliSats a sub Sat (1/1000), with higher decimal precision for microtransactions and streaming payments (Sats symbol).There are several implementations of the protocol, notably:-C-lightning developed by Blockstream in C language-Eclair, french for Lightning, a Scala implementation by ACINQ-LND (Lightning Network Daemon) node by Lightning Labs in GoTechnical difficulties and solutions:-finding viable paths -&gt; Pickhardt routing-privacy leakages -&gt; PTLCs (Point Time Locked Contracts), trampoline routing-force-closed channel -&gt; solves itself with timeResearch by River (2023), Fidelity Report as well as Analysis EngineBitcoin Lightning wallets - Comparison (by darthcoin @substack):Self-Custody LN wallets - Test (by AnitaPosch - tested in Africa):Phoenix, Mutiny, Blixt, Green, Zeus, Wallet of Satoshi(custodial), with conclusion:Phoenix topped the rankings for its overall performance and reliability, followed by Mutiny for its user-friendliness.Next is a table with selected ones that are fully mobile wallets.

The reason being is that, since it is centralized and countries have monopoly over it, in the long period (50 to 100 years), it gets corrupted (e.g. US abandoned the Gold Standard in 1971). As such, it is misused which ends up with currency devaluation and high or hyper runaway inflation, as history often proved. Temptation to overuse money printer is just irresistible. That results in citizens’ savings being stolen, capital destroyed and economy broken. In addition, makes it easier to wage unjustified wars, fuels populist politicians, and at the same time increases wealth gap with rising inequality (income not keeping pace with price rise). As we all know Central Planning never ends well, and neither does money planning (unsolvable problem of lack of data).– So the proposal was to break this vicious circle by making a decentralized system where no authority will be able to print money with a click of a button (The separation of money and state). Similarly, Gutenberg printing press contributed to separation of church and state by making books widely available (it democratized knowledge).Money is an abstract concept and a social construct of humankind, very old innovation that even precedes writing. Also it is a proxy for time, the most valuable human resource. Some would define it as shared esthetics between humans with mobility through time and space. And people don’t want more money, but what they can buy with it. So inflation is stealing people’s time, it is deceitful and ineffective, and disintegrates the cement that binds society together.– In principle Bitcoin is not anti-government, just for more efficient and transparent administration with proper checks and balances, opposite of today’s bureaucracy. It is not an overstatement to say Bitcoin could free mankind from the bondage of oppressive and war-loving governments. We could say it is a movement towards financial liberalization and independence, individual sovereignty, autonomy and freedom(money). Practical and feasible attempt to fix the flawed monetary system (broken money), in other words Bitcoin fixes the Money (Integrity being core belief). Money is information but it currently has errors, and BTC is error correction. It is antithetical to centralised money creation (digital printing). Countries have unfoundedly taken absolute control over money. Seigniorage is Not part of basic social contract, and legitimacy of governments regarding monetary control is questionable. Last 100 years with dominance of monetary policy over economy is unnatural state, an exception in long history of money, when observed from its origin.– To quote F.A.Hayek, an austrian school economist, and author of ‘The Denationalization of Money’ who predicted Bitcoin in 1984 in one interview:“Governments mostly abuse money and have stop its improvement, also Monetary policy has done only harm. I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly, roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop.”– Furthermore Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman in 1999 has stated:“Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that’s missing, that will soon be developed, is the reliable e-cache.” (electronic cache)– Let’s also mention David Chaum, well-known cryptographer, who said: “Privacy in messaging and payments, and the like, is so fundamental to democracy.”– Bitcoin open protocol is simply the first functional implementation of this radical concept (courtesy of Cypherpunks). It is programming language (code) for communicating value and platform of trust which can run currency as a software (the Internet of Money). Non-Inflationary sound money that is internet native, digital, smart (programmable), neutral (agnostic to politics) as bottom up emerging phenomenon (John Nash’s Ideal Money).Also being fully permissionless, censorship resistant and trustless, since people trust is often breached by large organisations (countries, big banks, mega corps). Can also be defined as free speech money, with keeping freedom even after speech.– As an Opt-In ecosystem it represents peaceful resistance from currency manipulation and debasement.It was elegantly designed and programmed to have the best characteristics of Money: 1. Durable, 2. Divisible, 3. Portable, 4. Acceptable, 5. Scarce, 6. UniformFixes bad features of gold regarding authenticity (hard to verify), difficult division (need melting) and expensive portability (costly transfer) because of which shiny yellow metal was concentrated and centralised (Bullish Case).In technical sence it is upheld by a significant computer science breakthrough: Decentralised Digital Scarcity, that is made using cryptography and which solved double-spending problem. Being Digital does not means it is ‘Virtual’ or imaginary as it has real world costs and effects with consequences.Way Forward– Next to lay out one possible way how we could get to this system. Since BTC is Scarce (most important feature) while state-issued (Fiat) currency is constantly inflationary and loses value (fiat fraud), people have INCENTIVE to save as much in Bitcoin. It represent hedge against inflation, often characterised as the ‘invisible thief’ or plainly theft, and also against systematic institutional collapse. What’s more it is not only hedge but also permanent solution for inflation. Institutional trust system were made for smaller industrial societies and now can’t scale to globalised information based society.– Proposition here is that it serves as (1) SoV - Store Of Value (digital Gold 2.0) in the long period (disregarding short term volatility). Let’s not forget that Value is partly subjective, so it is perceived, and not intrinsic in things. It has value precisely because of users’ desire to participate in a monetary system that does not have a central issuing authority (it is like ungovernable money).Later when almost everybody has some of it, they will start paying and accepting it directly (creating circular economy) instead of converting it into Fiat that relies on faith in state. And so it slowly takes on the function of (2) MoE - Medium of Exchange. From that moment you will not need to sell it, instead will simply be spending it.And the third phase (if it ever comes to this one) could be when prices are in it, so (3) UoA - Unit of Account feature (universal currency).– BTC has enormous potential as it could be great at all 3 function, be first triple point asset, unique in history (has ability to change the world). Each phase (1), (2), (3) could last from 10 to 15 years (free estimate). Pre phase 0 was until recently - accumulations as Collectibles, with price discovery.Here is one interesting idea. In current century average life span is estimated to be 84 years and half of that is 42 - answer to money. It will probably take at least that much for Bitcoin to grow to its full potential, so by mid century in 2050. This means that those who were 42 old in 2008 will live to see it, while new generation born then will be 42, in their best years (generational change).– Similar to internet evolution (1980-2020) with S-Curve growth (gradually then suddenly). With one important distinction that now there is direct value available for investing. Because of that it is prone to cyclic price swings with many speculators in the space, and that’s why adoption here also goes in cycles.And if we go even further in the past we could observe how cars replaced horses, and see how some opposed the transport evolution. The same way some people today still oppose the financial evolution (bitcoin revolution). Even Henry Ford said, to paraphrase: It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.Don’t Understand Bitcoin? Here’s 24 Reasons You Really Should. (Nobody Understands Bitcoin and that’s OK.)Why Is Bitcoin So Hard to Understand? (for most people)– First step will be selective adoption by 1% - the trendsetters (passionate supporters).One assessment is that by 2030 adoption could get to 10%, just the right number as a tipping point for critical mass acceptance. By then it will be visible if it is going in this direction. At this point in time some consider this will inevitably happen.And around 2040-2050 we will know the final result (needs generational change). In the best case 1 BTC could be worth million+ $ after long monetization process, while gradually demonetizes gold. At that point it would significantly stabilize, and until then volatility would be lower each cycle. Bitcoin offers gradual soft landing for todays over-leveraged keynesian economy.Still many mainstream economists oppose this idea, because of professional bias and/or personal, or not understanding the concept fully - having too narrow world wide.– Also between countries there is Game Theory dynamics (USA, Russia, etc) so even some of them blocking it (aka China) can not stop it, besides ideas are bulletproof. And if few make it treasury reserve asset and/or legal tender, others would eventually join (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out). In geopolitics US dollar has already started slowly to lose its supremacy as world reserve currency (De-dollarization) and Will Bitcoin replace Dollar? Still, it is actually in USA interest to support Bitcoin (Triffin dilemma solution), with inclusive regulatory framework, because it is their best option for the future and to rebuild it with better foundation (taking into account a power shift from the West to the East). Probably it will first be more used in developing countries (global south mainly) that lack financial services (bank the unbanked, remittances without intermediaries) and have weak currencies (Bitcoin’s ‘moral imperative’). Some will completely skip bank account, and leap frog directly into money app on smartphone, especially younger tech-savvy generation.As of December 15, 2024, FASB’s fair value accounting rules for Bitcoin simplified accounting for digital assets and allowed companies to report unrealized gains as part of their net income.On January 23, 2025, the SEC published SAB 121 to rescind previous 121 that required an entity to recognize a liability and corresponding asset for its obligation to safeguard crypto assets.Then on March 7, 2025, the US president signed an Executive Order for establishing strategic Bitcoin reserve.– On the other hand, there were attempts to introduce CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) as a kind of counter-revolution (in US now forbidden), but it is only digital Fiat with more surveillance and therefore will not pass.And even banks decision to embrace Bitcoin can be analysed from a game-theoretic perspective, where the payoff for each player (financial institution) depends not only on their own decision but also on the decisions of others (market race).– So this would be free-market chosen hard money, just as history suggests always happens (Thiers’ law - good money will drive out bad one, on commodity level field). But since it is not centralized it would keep permanently its hard cap (no central point of control/failure to increase the supply - removes the fallible human element). At the end there would be balance with its total monetary units and the entire world economy (Hyperbitcoinization - everything divided by 21 million). Each Satoshi or Sat, Bitcoin subunit, would be stake in the abundant future (hope for better tomorrow and future generations).It would be like a precise numerical measurement system for the economic activity - measuring stick (1 meter unit also does not change even as we have taller buildings).Possible effects:– people would spend more prudently (it imposes discipline), and would take only calculated risks/credits– lower time preference, long-term mindset, less consumerism of junk goods (no overconsumption)– real wages that keep purchasing power with mild price deflation leading to greater prosperity  (no need to ask for raise just to keep pace with inflation - bad) – fair distribution of economic growth by removing silent regressive Tax known as inflation  (no Cantillon effect - those close to printing machine benefit the most, financial elite;    As opposed to today’s system were we have socialized loses and privatized gains)– simplified savings (also there is power of simplicity in Bitcoin architecture)Upcoming period– April 2024 is when next halving occurs. Event refers to reducing (by half) creation of new coins that miners receive as reward, and it happens every 4 years in cycles. Miner’s reward includes newly generated coins and also transaction fees that will become more relevant as time pases (similar to the ratio of principal and interest in an installment loan during the repayment period).Because many are buying regulary, doing DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) and Stacking Sats (accumulating Bitcoin) it should lead to price hike approximately 2 times.It then gets media attention which attracts new people and traders, leading to hype and new all time high, that is followed by crash and bear market. So it has a specific market behavior but the 4 year moving average is constantly going up (logarithmic growth) and number of adopters increase with each round. Usage becomes easier as mobile apps are getting more user friendly every day. And imminent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs(Exchange-Traded Fund) will have additional impact on bull rally. To add here Fidelity research study Bitcoin First Revisited where it is explained why it should be considered separately from other digital assets. Also there is ARK-C Investment Case.Price rise can start several month before in anticipation of halving, so it is priced in but only partially. Expectations can lead to a self-fulfilling assumption.– If this logic is correct, and with multiplication factor (small liquidity can push price a lot), from current price of $ 27.000 on 2023/10/01, by the end of 2025 it could peak in range between 100 and 200+ thousand USD. After this in 2026 or 2027 maybe it will fall back again to little below 100 K, down to 50% of cycle maximum (estimation based on rainbow price chart - an informed guess). This could be the last cycle with such predictability. Another intriguing prediction model is The Bitcoin Power Law Theory (long term pow-law). If proved correct we could expect for next 10 years Bitcoin price to raise in average 20 to 30 % per year, when looked in 4+ year period (200 week average).Very rarely in history was there an asset that is safe to hold while also having the most upside potential. At the moment, in beginning of phase (1) it is still an investment (like stocks), and an asymmetric bet (possible upside much greater then downside).Macro-Economic analysis (fixed money supply characteristics): 1. A singular interoperable global protocol for value transfer - Bitcoin Standard (standardization of money). It means no issues with conversion between currencies for global trade and international e-commerce (single common economic language with Supranational currency). Economies converge on single form of money (convergence with investment trends).Superior new monetary order optimally engineered from First-principles thinking to be as efficient as possible.It encompass several domains, 3 main ones being: Ethics, Economy, Engineering (EEE). 2. This would be apolitical money, and as such an excellent candidate for world neutral reserve currency. Those countries that would make it their legal tender woud effectively no longer have full active monetary policy, only fiscal. They could have some sort of reserve state fund for unexpected situations. The Economy itself could have natural business cycles and probaby become more stable in the long run. Swings should be smaller since they could not artificialy rise as much because there is no government bailout (remember 2008 financial crisis, after which bankers got away without repercussions while Fed kept 0 rates for years making big asset boom). However most large countries would still keep their local currencies, at least for the foreseeable future. 3. Limited supply would not be fundamentally a problem as long as it is divisible downwards: 1 BTC = 100 million Satoshies (Sat-s). Total amount of units is 2.1 quadrillion, 21 mil * 100 mil (8 digits + 8 decimals) and Lightning even enables miliSats (1/1000). Try to avoid bias of unit size, it is not objectively relevant.If the world economy grows on average 1% per year, some things would reduce its price by 1%. Of course, others with higher efficiency of manufacturing, enabled by technological progress, would fall even more to marginal cost of production and some could rise if there would be extra demand.Also there is no risk of deflationary spiral since that is only possible in today’s Money As Debt system (Credit Money - created with each new credit while being destroyed when debt is paid off). 4. Hoarding is not an issue, as humans have everyday needs, but also wants, and would spend, save and invest during their life (nobody lives forever).So there would be an equilibrium at any moment in time. 5. Credits could be a little more expensive than today, since they would have real cost. But it would give the correct price signal to market participants, resulting with less capital misallocation (inflation distorts the signal and Finding SIGNAL In A Noisy World - EXCELENT article, recommend to READ).Banks could be like in Free Banking, and would need to take care about duration of credits and term deposit. Central Bank (CB) would be obsolete in current function as it could not act as lender of last resort (could remain solely as an administrator of countries reserves), and this also would eliminate Modern Monetary Theory (MMT).There would mostly be Full-reserve banking, limited with time deposits. And even if some type of Fractional-reserve banking emerges it would have an upper bound to risk exposure. No more too risky loans without any collateral, so called NINJA loans (No Income, No Job, no Assets) - one of causes of the ‘08 crisis.Suppression in complex systems often leads to worste outcome, so forsed low interest rates incentivize too much debt consumption. Analogy is in forest when small fires are immediately put out and then latter comes one large one because of all the small bushes that remained.Real estates would have lower prices since they would not serve as a Store of Value and would lose that monetary premium (reduced cost of housing).Also to add an emergence of Bitcoin Money Market Funds.To substantiate these claims there is an excellent article:Why a fixed supply money does not lead to economic catastrophe(And why it is in fact the only intellectually and ethically defensible monetary system)In addition take a look at how inflation steals your wealth and why bitcoin offers a solutionAlso: How does the economy work without inflation?Finally to address and elaborate some often given scepticism towards it: 1. Others cryptocurrencies (alt coins) are not real competition to Bitcoin because of:First mover advantage (organic creation that can’t be replicated), larges Network effect momentum, best governance model (no known founder - follow the rules, not the ruler). Next it has most decentralized miners hashrate and wide node distribution, biggest community (contributors, developers) with strong ideological conviction, deep commitment and ever growing adoption from users (it became a brand). There is a phrase: Bitcoin, Not ‘Crypto’. Note that digital scarcity is a one-time phenomenon with Bitcoin having greatest network effect (catch-22).Besides ingenious system integration of all components, one novel item stands out as vital and that is Difficulty Adjustment of mining. It is a self-balancing probabalistic mechanism to keep issuance of new coins in line with predetermined schedule (this flexibility makes it hard and solid).– On the other hand, cryptos using PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus model are ‘securities’ like, do not have true decentralization, and are virtual in nature. They have no separation of power, and Staking is essentially a centralizing force. Some of them might find another use case but not as honest and reliable money, as that is too important function. Bitcoin is entirely self-contained (self-referential) and not capable of enforcing anything that exists outside the network, nor is any blockchain (the oracle problem, as saying goes: Bitcoin, Not Blockchain).Only Bitcoin is considered as digital Commodity (exists in cyberspace) and primary monetary good, confirmed as such by the SEC (US Security Exchange Commission). It is nascent Bearer Asset without issuer and digital Property (inalienable property rights).So those others systems are neither money coins nor currencies, they can only be some type of tokens (alt-token can not be money). One practical use case is to represent share of a company, or to have some specific feature.– Also Side-chains (Liquid as an example) or Drive-chains (BitVM) as second layers could be better then separate Alts since they can tap into Bitcoin L1 base security. Even some Alts have a bridge to connect with BTC using Wrapped Bitcoin. Then there is RGB, a smart contract system on lightning nework.And any real new innovation, since all are open source, could be added into Bitcoin with new updates. For example Litecoin is somewhat of a Test network for Bitcoin, Lightning feature was first implemented there. Similarly zk-rollup (zero-knowledge) originally implemented in Ethereum is being considered for Bitcoin. Still any change must keep main principles but also be backward compatible, as protocol base layer should not change too much (You don’t change Bitcoin, it changes you). Any alterations must be done very carefully because Bitcoin network has a fiduciary duty. 2. As for the criticism of being slow, there is a good reason for it, or a few of them.Distributed ledger can have only limited size and growth based on world wide average internet connection and average disk size. Also all world transactions do not (and should not) need to be on public ledger. One payment for coffee has no place on a permanent immutable database whose main job it to uphold monetary policy (emphasis on structural efficiency). It is Blockchain trilemma between 1.Decentralisation, 2.Security, 3.Scalability.So the only feasible solution, a trade-off, was to limit number transactions per second on the main layer, and solve scalability on top layers. In the future it is expected that the base layer would serve as a settlement between lightning nodes, custodians and banks with published proof of reserves and liabilities, countries, etc. Just like today there is RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) or GIRO as interbank clearing, or similar to how swift works. Therefore regular transactions would be on Lightning and other Layer 2 (L2) solutions, where it is faster (instant), low cost (1000 cheaper than visa), has bigger capacity (potentially 1 million+ TPS) and with more privacy. Large capacity is excellent for micropayments, a usecase that was not possible before. As a global settlement layer it is actually extremely fast, has finality in 30 minutes, instead of 3+ days with legacy systems.– We can make analogy with PayPal which is a Method of Payment but the underlying Medium of Exchange is still the dollar. The same way Lightning or even some custodial payment service would be method of payment while Bitcoin can remain as a Medium of Exchange.Interesting note to mention here is that on top of lightning rails we could see implementation of StableSats that could be used instead of centralized stable coins USDT/USDC, until the Bitcoin Sats themselves become stable enough.And last but not least it can fuel new social media network like Nostr, also known as decentralised twitter (now X), where the user is owner of his data (The Tyranny of KYC published on Primal - nostr web client app). 3. To be future-proof from changes towards the inflationary model it needs high level decentralization which requires real world cost (anchor in physical reality). That is manifested in digital ‘mining’ so called Proof of Work - PoW, consensus mechanism with a fascinating power projection (backed by energy).Regarding this power consumption, the argument is that using 0.3 to 0.6 % of the world’s electricity is pretty cheap to have a global high-quality monetary network for the long term. Even the banking industry today has higher power expenditure than this. At the same time miners can help stabilize the grid (symbiotic relationship) and also they can consume stranded and wasted energy.Electrical production is another issue and in the future all power should be sustainable and from renewable sources. 4. On the issue of fair distribution, early adopters are fairly rewarded for the risk and time they invested. Also Holders for having nerves of steel and determination to hold (HODL meme) for long through uncertainty and turbulent times (BTC as only certain thing for foreseeable future - Tick Tock Next Block). It takes courage and resilience to stay committed during dips and bust. And without them the network would not be able to survive at an early stage. Besides most early buyers and miners have sold theirs coins at one point during the bumpy ride. And lastly it is becoming more evenly distributed over time.ConclusionPersonal assessment currently is that Bitcoin has 51% chance of growing and expanding(in 2017 was 30% and in 2013 maybe 10% then).The longer it exists (15 years so far) the higher are chances of succeeding (Lindy effect), as it grows stronger and becomes more robust (was rigidly tested).Like any investment it is a venture, as every decision in life is. For risky ones, invest only what you can afford to lose.But sometimes not investing anything is also another type of risk. For an average portfolio, whether personal or standard from a fund, the current recommendation is to allocate 5 to 10% in BTC (with greater conviction, a higher proportion goes).Also keep better part of them off crypto exchanges (Self-Custody - not your keys, not your coins).Either way, it’s always good to be educated on the subject.DYOR (Do Your Own Research) and make your probability for each hypothetical scenario.Stick to power of natural attraction and not forcible promotion.Apps and Services for regular buying and/or DCAing Bit (BTC-DCA_CompareSheet) with Credit/Debit Card for future spending and retirement:| 1.River | 2.Strike | 3.CashApp (US only) | 4.Swan |Other popular Europe based options are:| pocketbitcoin(Swiss) | peachbitcoin(Swiss) | relai(Swiss) | 21bitcoin(Austria) |Local version of the BlogPost has few additional exchanges from the SouthEast Europe (in countries SRB, BIH, HRV)**If DCAing into self custody DO take care about UTXO management - minimum base transation 0.01 BTC to be future-proof from high feesOther Bitcoin only Exchanges: guidesYT talks to listen:-Bitcoin is World Hope (Natalie Brunell) -Introduction: What is bitcoin and why does it matter?

In a futuristic context, first word to mention is Bitcoin, or short BTC (₿). To explain it, there is a phrase saying: “It’s an Answer, and let’s see now what the Question is”. For better understanding we need first to grasp the history of money and current monetary systems.– Discussion is lengthy as is the nature of topic, so it’s divided into segments for easier comprehension.Do not be discouraged if material seems foreign. Since it is abundant with various information, recommendation is to read it across multiple days and sleep over it. After first reading a lot of questions will pop up. Many terms and events are linked directly to articles, blogs forums and YT channels / podcasts. That way you can read even more about certain subject, and also leave a comment or question at the bottom.– What’s important is to get the idea and fundamentals, and how to engage with it. For those who want to know it deeply some estimate is that minimum 100 Hours of Study (100 h. learning) is needed to dive into this thing.And the more you know the more you want to find out, so-called: Falling ‘Down the (Bitcoin) Rabbit Hole’ (metaphor for adventure into the unknown from Alice in Wonderland). It will make you think but simultaneously broaden your horizons.One comedian even said:“It’s everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t understand about computers”.But as you start to learn it, subsequently you will gain knowledge about economics, computer science, math, philosophy, politics, history, and even physics.PSSome final touch and refactoring is continuously in progress.1 Monetary Chronicles1.1 Beginning of Money [C]– When people switched from hunter-gatherers to agriculture and farming around 10,000 years ago, it led to specialization in work, higher productivity and accumulation of surplus products. This enabled creation of bigger settlements, cities and eventually states. It also meant people could exchange (barter) excess things they got or made, for example grains or animals but it was not easy to determine the value of each item nor to split it. Credit, as a promise, was probably the oldest means of trade and will remain with us, with bartering transactions being later developed. Also larger communities meant you need to trade with strangers and some base for trust was needed (Dunbar’s number - one can only maintain about 150 close relationships). They needed a system which would make trade easier. That’s why money was invented and how it came into being.– In the early days numerous things were used like special looking seashells, rare stones, etc. There is an interesting story about African trade glass beads (hyper-inflation misuse for slave trade) and another one about large stones (Rai stones) of Yap people. Stones were primitive credit system. Later came metals and metal coins, from bronze, silver or gold. If one is wondering why these materials were chosen, it’s best first to define features of money (The money Project) since it is an abstract concept: FUNCTION Description 1. Medium of Exchange accepted method of payment for goods and services 2. Unit of Account measure of value 3. Store of Value to hold value for long period of time Examples of Function: 1. Society uses certain item like pearl to trade for other goods 2. Housing prices in Japan can be compared using Jen as a unit of account 3. An ounce of gold could buy toga in Roman times, yet it can still buy a nice suit today PROPERTIES Description 1. Durable able to withstand repeated use 2. Divisible can divide into smaller units 3. Portable easily carried and transported 4. Acceptable universally recognizable 5. Limited supply being rare(scarce) keeps stable value (preserves purchasing power) 6. Uniform units capable of mutual substitution, interchangeable (fungible) – Obviously Gold had qualities to fulfill most of these roles, but it is not perfect, only best at that time, or the least bad. Some of the disadvantages were: not so easy to carry - expensive transport (low Portability), hard to Divide (need to melt), and danger of theft and robbery. Still it became the most salable one.– Because of that some merchants, later private banks and then central banks started holding gold for people and gave them certificates of how much gold they have. People then used those certificates, as Claim on items, for trade. That’s how paper money also called banknotes (promissory notes - IOU acronym of ‘I owe you’) or colloquially cash came in existence. But bad side was introduction of intermediaries one needs to trust. And history is full of examples were that confidence was exploited for all kind of reasons, usually by creating more notes than there was gold to back it. It led to bankruptcy of private banks or hyperinflation by central banks, both resulted in the same outcome, people losing their savings and purchase power. Bankscan be with Full reserves or with Fractional reserves. One of the first central banks was Bank of Amsterdam (‘Amsterdamsche Wisselbank’) that was established back in 1609. Eventually most countries seized full monetary control and further development of money came to a halt.– Even in Roman times gold and silver coins were, on demand from emperors, occasionally debased by melting them and leaving smaller quantity of precious metal. Eventually coins became totally worthless, and financial decadence was one the reasons the empire toppled. Also, coins were sometimes cut and scratched by thieves. To prevent clipping modern coins usually have Reeded edges (grooved lines that encircles perimeter), a counter-counterfeiting practice devised by Isaac Newton who was at a time Warden of the Royal Mint.– Money is language, a linguistic and social construct, used as means of communicating value to each other. It is also collective and somewhat fictional narrative about value, with consent of majority. So, it is not inherently valuable, we (subjectively) decide to give it merit. Human labor is still typically measured by working hours, so Money is also proxy for Time, the most valuable currency (one second lost cannot be bought back). Another way of framing it, Money is claims on wealth.– According to Information Theory of Money prices and the market are intricately intertwined. Prices reflect information while Money is the measuring stick, and Information is Decentralized. So centralized systems have an unsolvable data problem because of lack of all the necessary knowledge entire time, which results in huge capital misallocation.YT - Finance: The History of Money1.2 Recent History [C]– Until 19th century Silver coins were mostly utilized for local Currency, while Gold was used only for high value or international transactions. Definition of Currency: Measure in a specific time and place, medium of exchange and legal tender (must be accepted for deferred payment of debt) with strong network effect. Around 1870 switch to Gold was made because silver became abundant, and when it’s not Rare it cannot be good money. That’s how the so-called ‘Gold Standard’ was created in which paper notes were backed by physical gold. That was one of most stable and prosperous periods.– It was temporarily suspended during WW1 when countries, to fund the war efforts, needed to print more money then allowed. Also, there were exceptions from it during the Great Depression. It’s worth remarking here that the USA (United States of America) in 1933 seized all gold bullion and coins from its citizens and forced them to sell it below market price.Again, during WW2 money was overprinted and Gold Standard dropped. Then in 1944, shortly before the end of the war, there was the Bretton Woods Agreement where 44 allied countries agreed to use US Dollar (USD - $) as world’s Reserve Currency and for international trading and settlement. Reason it was the US dollar is that the USA was the dominant power at the time, both economically and militarily, which meant it had the greatest influence on the world. It also had biggest reserve of gold, of their own and of allied countries that was shipped there during WW2 for safekeeping. Still Keynes advocated, on behalf of UK, BanCor supranational system but the US insisted on dollar, even if being bad for them in the long run, aka Triffin’s Dilemma/Paradox.– Later the US slipped into a huge budget deficit, caused by excessive domestic spending and by Vietnam war, so the easiest solution was to print more money than there was gold to back it. That finally led to 1971 when the US government with Richard Nixon as president decided to abandon the Gold Standard, meaning dollars were not redeemable for gold from US reserves. After that in 1975 the USA made deal with major Oil producing countries, Saudi Arabia deal in the first place, that they sell primary energy commodity in US dollars. In return US will give them military protection and make sure sea routes are safe for tankers, with the help of navy. That’s how the term Petrodollars came, an unofficial system or simply a global practice where dollars were desirable since one could exchange them easily for much needed barrels of petroleum. Some would say dollars were backed by crude oil, most important resource of 20th century. In the following decades USA was exporting inflation to the rest of the world while importing real goods.1.3 Modern age [C]– In the modern age money has become more digital, essentially just numbers in computers of private and central banks, as well as in World bank and IMF (International Monetary Fund). First thing is that most money today is created as Debt (Credit theory of money - Credit creation). Essentially whenever someone gets a loan from the bank for a car or house or whatever, the bank just types that amount into a computer and new money is created while the entire money supply increases. Still when the debt is repaid that money gets destroyed or in a sense deleted.– So in theory this could be stable, so that the economic output of a country is mapped to credit demand while Money Supply gets balanced the right way. However, in practice it is never like this, instead artificial push of loans, money markets, government agendas, etc. make it unstable and prone to corruption and crises with only solution always to inflate/increase the money supply. Temptation to use money printer is just irresistible.Examples of Crises: 1. The Recent event that triggered an overprint was the Economic Crisis of 2008 which was partly created by banks who gave too many risky credits for real estate backed only by mortgages. And when it all collapsed the government just printed more money to cover it. Excuse was that letting all those banks fail would collapse entire economy both the US and the rest of the world. But if something is too big to fail, then it is too big to exist in the start. Still all people paid for the bank misbehavior while managers of those banks at the same time got huge bonuses. Wall Street corruption was exposed with Payment for Order Flow under the counter and with gray area of Short Selling - Short and Distort (Hedge Funds under investigation).There are some interesting movies about this subject and link with Wall Street such as: The Big Short (Investors Who Lost $9 Billion) and Margin Call. They explain Derivatives like CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation) and Synthetic ones, complexly structured financial products, with bonds of subprime mortgage (risky loans to individuals with poor or no credit history) that were used for betting (Wall Street - Intelligent Casino and Gambling Parlor). 2. Another even bigger example was Covid-19 pandemic during 2020/2021 that resulted in printing new additional 40 % of all the money in existence. As a result we now face threat of Stagflation, inflation rate goes up, while economic growth and employment go down.– In essence there are 2 types of money: commodity-based and credit based. There is also a term Fiduciary Media, which is money issued by third party, for example by some Bank, and it’s a form of credit.– Almost all money today is FIAT, declared by a government decree and not supported by physical commodity. It is determined by authority, made to be legal-tender (taxes as type of debt are paid with it), and imposed by force (Political -&gt; Policy -&gt; Police). One could say Fiat is backed by an implicit threat of violence. Based on Trust that is often betrayed and backed only by promise it is sometimes referred as Fiat Fraud or colloquially Fiat Fuckery. Fiat is artificial ‘checkbook’ money that also constraints real production (Joyless economy). Fiat forces capital misprice, that leads to misallocation. Because of that a lot of money gets wasted that could otherwise be used for more productive things and investments. Fiat also artificially manipulates people time preference.– Some consider Money printing (‘fiat mining’) to be UBI (Universal Basic Income) but for the rich. Since new money is routinely first available to people close to those in power (Cantillon effect) and to ones that already have it as they can take big credits and own assets other than cash that are more inflation proof.– The way a country can get more money for budget spending is that the Treasury issues Bonds and the Central Bank (CB) prints that amount of money and buys those bonds. In the US case it’s the FED (Federal Reserve System - history), whose foundation were laid by Alexandar Hamilton. Today most money is not in the form of paper cash but is digital. Creating new money is simply typing digits on the computers of banks that are saved to a database.– Also monetary tools and systems are made very complex. Some would argue deliberately in order to obfuscate it and make it less transparent and more obscure so that fewer people would object to the system itself. One of the printing mechanisms is QE-Quantitative Easing, where banks have the right to issue credits, meaning to print money as already explained, based on deposits they have, in ratio 1:10 or even more (Fractional Reserve Banking). Opposite policy is known as Quantitative Tightening. While CB’s Fiat system creates massive extended credit with horrible consequences, Fractional Banking is distinct and not necessarily bad. Next to define term base point that is 1/100 part of percent or 0.01 %, since it is often used when stating CB interest rates.– It is not just central bank that prints money but also commercial ones all around the world. Let’s now introduce the notion of Eurodollar - dollar deposits at foreign banks or American banks branches outside of US (mostly in Europe). They deserve notice because they are not subject to regulation nor reserve requirements. In this regard it is hard to even know exactly the total supply of money in existence (all-of-the-worlds-money).– In addition, there are different layers of money:-M1 = base money (currency in circulation, checking and savings accounts, checks)-M2 = M1 + money market funds-M3 = M2 + other financial instrumentsTrustis a confident relationship with the unknown, a social glue that bridges the gap:Known &lt;—&gt; TRUST &lt;—&gt; UnknowIt’s a currency of interactions.The way to build more trust is to be more transparent and in time you become trustworthy (have reputation capital).Lately we could observe breach of trust (as explained by Rachel Botsman) in many areas like: 1. News International phone hacking 2. Global Financial Crisis resulted with only 1 banker jailed 3. Volkswagen emissions scandal 4. Panama papers showing powerful politicians exploiting offshore tax regime 5. Corona Covid-19 Pandemic vaccine and lockdown policyEvidently institutional trust (legacy system) is no longer working, because it was not designed for digital age. N INSTITUTIONAL DISTRIBUTED 1 Opaque Transparent 2 Closed Inclusive 3 Centralized Decentralized 4 Licensed Accountable 5 Top-down Bottom-up 1.4 Sum it so far [C]– Countries have the complete control of money and can inflate it for various reasons with several economic tools. That power is then often misused by political elites and corporations while chasing profits (somewhat greedy), that results in high inflation or in some cases even hyperinflation. This sort of inflation’s Moral Hazard is practically an additional hidden (regressive) Tax on population that nobody voted for. One could argue it’s theft in a sense or financial robbery since it dilutes person savings. It is slowly siphoning wealth from the average person to the politically well-connected. And while prices of all goods just increase, salaries do not always grow to keep up, instead workers have to explicitly asks it from employers. So small wage raise does not mean more purchase power, it’s just to keep up with inflation.(“Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation” - M. Friedman)– State Institutions ordinarily measure Inflation as scalar, just 1 number, CPI (Consumer Price Index) that includes only basket of basic goods. However, it is actually a vector because not everybody buys, needs, and wants the same things, so essentially index is mostly fake. Besides just surviving in real world people also desire real estate, traveling, stocks, arts, etc. Instead of just targeted 2 percent according to CPI, true inflation was around 6 to 7 %. And lately even by CPI is 10 % or more. It’s good to learn the Percentage and Interest calculation, in line with quote: “Compound Interest is the eighth wonder of the worldHe who understands it, earns it, he who doesn’t, pays it.”, that is often attributed to Albert Einstein but no evidence he said it. In the entire history of interest rates during 6 centuries, it fluctuated from 0 to 15 %, with domination first of Dutch, then British, and eventually Americans.– Until recently stock markets were one way to have hedge against inflation, but that was also just for small minority (only around 10 % of people have significant saving in stock). And now also Bitcoin, is seen as another way of protection and insurance against currency debasement (antidote to inflation), and better in certain aspects. Also, it is time consuming to follow all information regarding stock markets and regular people can hardly keep up with various financial instrument used by professional investors.– Gold was another safe haven, and some are still proponents of it, so called ‘gold bugs’, despite its imperfect characteristics. In the 2000s there were even electronic gold systems, like ‘e-gold’ but they were centralized and eventually banned by the government. That’s why BTC is considered to be Digital Gold or Gold 2.0 as it has many good features of Gold but at the same time fixes the bad ones. Metaphorically speaking it is like teleporter for Gold. Therefore, Bitcoin was innovative Solution to problem how to have Hard or Sound money that cannot be overprinted and is also practical to use (term Sound coming from melodious ring when metal coin is dropped on hard floor). Has speed of Fiat but still keeps scarcity of Gold and was programmed to mimic gold’s stable inflation rate. Just like gold does not change much the network should also run the same for several decades.– Acknowledged Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises in his book “The Theory of Money and Credit” (1912) argued that Sound money is: “an instrument for the protection of civil liberties and a means of limiting government power. It is also a commonly used medium of exchange and a method for obstructing the government’s propensity to meddle with the currency system.” More detailed explanation can be found in the article Bitcoin and the Theory of Money.– Another issue is the censorship that governments and banks can enforce. We could observe this happened in some Autocratic or Authoritarian countries for opposition but also in democratic ones. For example Canadian truckers whose bank accounts were frozen for protesting against pandemic lockdown, a ‘PC’ (Political Correct) way to silence the opposition. Bitcoin (only) solves this one as well since it can work without intermediary (trustless) and does not require a trusted party (Money should Not be weaponized, ever!). Additionally, it allows seamless transactions across borders. With Liberal world view and partly Libertarian philosophy (eliminate state coercion) part of its mission is separation of money and state. We shall never have decent money before we take monopoly of it away from government (make government smaller and people bigger). Also main function of state should be preservation of life, liberty and property.– Fiat enabled countries to wage war until they run out of all citizens wealth. Prior to paper currencies, governments would soon run out of fighting capability because population would rebel against tax for unpopular wars. There are those who hold opinion that reasons “a small war in Central Europe” in 1914 was able to explode into “the first global war in human history” were partly monetary rather than only geopolitical (From Fiat to Crypto).– All in all management of Money and Interventions by the state in most cases was done the wrong way.Even those with good intentions often had bad results: -Attempt to do good, imperfectly, and often creates more damage than good in pursuit of it  (“The Government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem” - M. Friedman) -When pay for it with inflation it unintentionally collapses the currency -Mismeasure the extent of monetary policy while underestimate the cost2. Bitcoin Explanation2.1 How it all started [C]– With the beginning of the Internet, information sharing via forums and mails also enabled global spread of ideas. Important movement in this regard was Crypto-anarchism as a political ideology (ideological origin) focusing on protection of privacy, political and economic freedom.– ‘The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto’ was one of the first written papers that articulated this idea, written by Timothy C. May in 1988 and shared at a Crypto conference (‘Arise, you have nothing to lose..’). Document introduced the basic principles of crypto-anarchism, encrypted exchanges ensuring total anonymity, absolute freedom of speech, and full freedom to trade. Another similar work at the time was ‘A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto’ for privacy by mathematician Eric Hughes (‘cypher’ derived from CYber and ciPHER). Later in 1992 a specific mail group called ‘Cypherpunks Mailing List’ was started and by 1994 had around 1000 subscribers. They were considering using cryptography to make digital Decentralized money.– US Intelligence services like NSA (National Security Agency), because of their spying programs, even tried to limit use and export of cryptographic tools. Those attempts were known as Crypto Wars, that privacy advocates opposed with Free speech rights.NSA still has systems like PRISM (prism-break), a worldwide surveillance program, that was exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Even Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, previously warned about such monitoring. And both of them had become most-wanted whistleblowers by the US government.– Just like there were torrent (data stream) networks for P2P Peer-to-Peer file sharing (music, films e.g. Napster, BitTorrent) this was imagined to be a network for digital value. Leading Big Tech companies are networks as well: Google - information; Facebook - social; There is also browser for privacy called TOR abbreviation from The Onion Router.– Two remarkable economists, both Nobel laureate, even predicted the rise of Bitcoin: 1. Friedrich A. Hayek in his Book ‘The Denationalization of Money’ (1976) argued for the end of the government’s monopoly on currency, and in one interview (first 3 min) in 1984 said:“Govs mostly abuse money and have stop its improvement, also Monetary policy has done only harm. We can’t take it violently out of the hands of government. All we can do is by some sly, roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop.”-He was proponent of Austrian School of economic thought (more free market, less government control).-On the opposing pole was John Maynard Keynes who was flag bearer of vigorous government intervention in the markets. His view was widely followed throughout the 20th century by many countries (Keynesian economy). 2. Milton Friedman, a free market economist, in 1999 stated:“Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that’s missing, that will soon be developed, is the reliable e-cache”.– One of the pioneers in the field and outstanding cryptographer is David Chaum, called the godfather of crypto. He was first to propose a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation ‘Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups’. In 1995 his company DigiCash created the first electronic ‘eCash’ system. DigiCash eventually failed because it entered the market before e-commerce was fully integrated within the Internet. Still some consider it partial predecessor of cryptocurrencies.– Relevant person to mention here is Nick Szabo, a bright computer engineer and legal scholar. In 1998 he designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called ‘BitGold’. It was never implemented but has been called ‘a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture’ since it was one of the earliest attempts at creating a decentralized digital currency. In the Bit Gold architecture, a participant would dedicate computer power to solving cryptographic puzzles. He is also credited with pioneering the concept of Smart Contracts.– Near the end of 2008 an anonymous person under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto (name anagram) published a marvelous White Paper named: BITCOIN: A Peer-To-Peer E-Cache System he designed. Definition of term White Paper: a report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body’s philosophy on the matter. This Paper itself references several other amazing works written in decades before it, and it was first sent to the cypher mailing list.– At the same time domain ‘bitcoin.org’ was registered through ‘anonymousspeech.com’ using a prepaid card that can be bought with cash at any local store so it is untraceable. Decision to use an alias and hide his identity was done in order to be unknown to the government but also probably to keep the network decentralized, meaning there is no single founder. Majority of people involved consider not having a father figure to be a feature, not a bug, since the main purpose of the network is to be decentralized.– In 2009 a post on the P2P foundation forum was written with additional explanation of the system. In the same year an Open Source implementation of the protocol was made, written in C++ programming language, and source code is currently hosted on GitHub code repository. These events unfolded just after the 2008 Economic Crisis, which seems to be the trigger. In first/genesis block there is encoded reference to London Times magazine article:“The Times 03/Jan/2009 - Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”. BTC logo – Receiver of the first BTC transaction and early contributor to the network was a computer scientist named Hal Finney. He was an American developer who worked for PGP Corp (Pretty Good Privacy) with Phil Zimmermann (OpenPGP) - first free implementations of public-private key encryption for (email) communication and to mention also. He also ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer and was involved with the cypherpunks mailing list (HRF launched ‘Finney Freedom Prize’). Among notable cryptographers and programmers whose work was cited in the BTC paper were Wei Dai (B-money) and British Adam Back (Hashcash) who today is CEO of Blockstream. All of them were part of The Cypherpunks community and movement and noteworthy members of the mail list, but also early contributors to the Bitcoin project (Len Sassaman and a Cypherpunk History).– So Satoshi could be any of them or someone else, maybe even more than one person, small team. It might always remain a mystery but in the end it doesn’t matter, the important thing is the result and the network itself. Initial improvements to the first website were done by Martti Malmi, a student from Finland.In the following years several persons were incorrectly suspected or falsely claimed to be Satoshi.– Creator of BTC Satoshi, at the end of 2010, made the last post that stated: There is more work to be done…. and since then, he has not made any known contact. The deployment of project was executed masterfully and not exposing himself by sitting on many coins without spending them. Nonetheless he become the legend, an elusive figure. Today we see that the project continued, and it became a game-changing product on a global scale. In the meanwhile, contributor Gavin Andresen became the lead developer till 2014 when Wladimir van der Laan from Amsterdam took over.– One peculiar note: First real-world Btc transaction was in May of 2010 for 2 large pizzas paid 10,000 BTC (consider current value of those - hundreds of millions $)The history of the cypherpunks2.2 Technical background [C]– From an engineering aspect Bitcoin protocol is a masterpiece software. We could see that the compelling idea has been circulating for some time and several components of it already existed. It is a culmination of 40 years of research and development (Bitcoin PreHistory) and Exploring Bitcoins History (also Planting Bitcoin and bitcoinspecies).But nevertheless, integrating it all into a functional unit was done ingeniously. Hats down to Satoshi whoever he / she or they be, for the first full implementation of this brilliant idea. He was a truly visionary and gave this gift to humanity. And the timing was just right. Firstly, the internet and cryptography were sufficiently developed. Secondly the political and economic situation was fertile as well, inspiration came from revolt.– Next, to define a word Bit (binary digit) - the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store, whose value can be 0 or 1. And now Let’s jump to the point:Bitcoin has a Ledger of transactions, which is a list stored in a database that is not centralized in one server but distributed on multiple computers called Nodes around the world. Ledger essentially enables reliable spreadsheet with Balances. It’s like immutable record that can’t be counterfeited. New transactions (~7 tps) are on average every 10 minutes grouped into a Block 1 MB in size that is added to the ledger. Each block is connected to previous ones by hash code that is not easy to find. That’s why this structure is called Blockchain, multiple blocks connected in a line, and it’s what underpins the system. It can be used for solving other problems as well. PROPERTIES of BLOCKCHAIN (type of DLT - Distributed Ledger Technology) Programmable e.g. Smart Contracts Secure all records are individually encrypted Anonymous the identity of participants is unknown, either fully or pseudo hidden Unanimous most of network participants agree to the validity of each of the records Distributed all participants have a copy of the ledger for complete transparency Immutable any validated records are irreversible and cannot be changed Time-stamped a transaction timestamp is recorded on a block From functional viewpoint is can be defined as the Great Chain of being sure about things.3 pillars of blockchain technology are: Decentralization, Transparency (Auditability), Immutability.– Hash is a cryptographic function that converts longer text into a relatively unique code (Message Digest) of fixed length, but reverse cannot be done in any practical time. This characteristic is used to do the so-called Mining, virtual one of course, a term taken from the gold industry. That work consists of trying an enormous number of combinations to find one where hash begins with several leading zeros (000…). Some like to draw analogy with Sudoku puzzle. All miners are competing to find it and when one does then a new block is finished and synced across the network. That miner also gets the reward of a certain amount of newly created coins.–In the long term based on statistics, every miner should get approximately equal sum, while on the other side they have spent electric power. Based on the number of participants, the algorithm adjusts the difficulty level to keep it always around 10 minutes. It’s done in a way that when there are more miners leading to more hash power difficulty increases which makes it harder to find a solution. This process is called PoW (Proof of Work), the term is self-explanatory, that consists of defined rules. The Nakamoto Consensus is a set of rules that verifies the authenticity of a blockchain network. It is using a combination of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm (consensus rules) on a BFT peer-to-peer network (BFT - Byzantine Fault Tolerance that solves Byzantine Generals Problem a situation in which majority of actors must agree on a coordinated strategy).– Another important thing to elaborate is PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), which is used here to sign digital info. Signing is done with a private key so others can confirm the signature using the public key, usually packed into a Digital Certificate. It ensures that no one can spend coins not belonging to them if they do not have the code aka private key. PKI is usually using RSA algorithm which is based on mathematical inability for large number factorization, to effectively find Prime factors. RSA can be used for digital encryption (hidden data) or for digital signature (ensures data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation). Others algorithms include SHA-256, Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic curve (ECDSA) (discrete logarithm problem). In particular Bitcoin uses the ECDSA algorithm with elliptic curve secp256k1.– Combination of these elements makes entire process quite intriguing and at the same time gives several positive consequences: 1. Prevents double spending - Digital Scarcity for the first time      (original in virtual realm that could not be copied, a groundbreaking innovation) 2. Guaranties integrity and security 3. Gives proper economic incentives to people using and maintaining the network      (Positive Feedback Loop: higher price, more attention, bigger demand)– It also makes good distribution throughout time with descending inflation, since reward generated with mining is halved every 4 years. Maximum number of coins is limited to 21 million (hard cap) that would be reached in year 2140 according to estimates. Currently, in 2022 almost 19 million is already created, about 90 %. When reward of new coins shrinks, transaction fee will remain for the miners. Some coins in early adoption period were lost due to owners losing key and Satoshi mined almost 1 million coins that were never moved from initial address. One estimate is that owners have misplaced almost 20 % of all existing tokens, which makes it even more scarce. Some have been wondering why specific amount of 21 million exactly was chosen for max number (joke for 42 as answer to everything, so Bitcoin with 21 answers half). The nominal quantity is not that important as long as it is defined and fixed. Reason being it is divisible, currently up to 8 decimals, and 1 BTC have 100 million satoshis (sats) as smallest unit.– Everybody should be aware that bitcoin is not anonymous, instead it is Pseudo-Anonymous, meaning transaction is public but it only has owner number. However, if someone ever connects that number to a person then it can be tracked. Ways to avoid being tracked are mentioned in paragraphs bellow.– Coins can be stored offline in a digital Wallet or on an exchange. Wallet is a password protected application on mobile or computer, with recovery secret code stored at another location in digital manner or written on paper. It enables full Self Custody, in accordance with expression: Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins! One should not be escaping responsibility, so Take custody of your coins. Worth noting are Cold storage as an offline wallet and hardware wallets for those who desire extra security (recommended when having large value).– Block infos:BlockExplorer; | BlockStream;BlockChain: charts &amp; blocks; | balance;2.3 Extended description [C]– As a new internet protocol Bitcoin enables transfer of value over communication channel. Other earlier application protocols include https (web page), ftp (file), smtp (mail), etc. With latest you can basically send gold coin like mail, any amount of value to anywhere in the world almost instantly. Without anyone being able to stop it or have control, it is Censorship Resistant and can’t be easily confiscated.It is the first case where Greed and Altruistic incentives aligns. You can now make most selfish decision and also contribute to greater equality in the world when compared to the fiat system. As such it is very useful technological innovation that enables distributed consensus but can also be looked at from various angles. When trying to fully understand it one need to grasp its multitude of aspects (interdisciplinary): 1. Economic (Monetary policy) - predefined and limited quantity (relatively fixed supply) 2. Technical (Distributed consensus) - decentralization 3. Political - reducing state monopoly on money 4. Ideological - freedom being core value being 5. Societal - Social agreement for monetary tool– YT videos:What is Bitcoin; | Explained Simply;How bitcoin work; | How blockchain work;For fun:-Bitcoin Rap Battle Debate: Hamilton vs. SatoshiTED talks:-Blockchain changing money and business (Don Tapscott)-Blockchain transform the economy (Bettina Warburg)-The future of money (Neha Narula)Bitcoin Governance is similar to 3-pronged (traditional) branches of Government. The Three Branches of Blockchain Governance (Separation of powers doctrine) GOV BIT Description 1. Judicial Full Nodes can veto miners 2. Executive Miners can veto devs 3. Legislative Developers help others bypass vetoes Legislative part also includes business and infrastructure analogous to Parliament (Representatives) while Devs are like Senate, and Miners act as hired security. End users are like citizens with voting right, or like shareholdler of a company, and everyone can freely become a node. If compared to enterprises best parallels can be drawn with IT (Information Technology) companies.– Product is global monetary currency and payment system and at the same time the Coin represents owners or shareholders. On the other side are Developers and Miners along with Nodes, like very wide Boards of Directors, Management and Supervisory.The Rules of Bitcoin: 1. No Confiscation 2. No Censorship 3. No Inflation 4. Anyone can verify rules 1-3– These rules are derived from protocol characteristic that make it exist in a narrow design space, its tiny niche. Delicate balance means that even a small alteration to one of coded parameters can break some other important feature significantly. It can be compared to gravitational constant that is limited to narrow band, where even a slight change would distort entire universe. This explains some critics about development going slowly (base chain must be little conservative). There is not much room for core changes, only fine-tuning improvements and building on top of it. Still there is no reason bitcoin could not adopt any fundamentally better technology improvement that keeps its core values.– There have been push to force some risky core changes but those attempts failed - Block Size Wars. One of proposal was to simply increase the size of Block to 2, 4 or even 8 MB, which was rejected because it does not solve long term scalability for entire world. At the same time, it bad effects on decentralization because it would drastically increase node memory requirements.On the other hand updates that passed like SegWit (Segregated Witness) and Taproot (with Schnorr signature) were more in line with the vision and brought only improvements making it faster, more efficient and private. But they first had to be developed and then 95% of miners (an overwhelming majority) needed to signal support for those to activate it. They are called BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Not having central command presents significant logistical challenges, but also that distinguishing feature ensures no central point of failure.– Bitcoin as a whole represents a Paradigm shift for Embodiment of capital that changed each century: 18th - farmland (agricultural age) 19th - factories, machines, bonds (industrial age) 20th - urban real estate, stocks (information age) 21th - virtual asset (digital &amp; distributed age)  - also called The Exponential Age    (Technology evolving the world at a rate faster than ever before)  - Simply put, the world is moving at light speedMore informal (loosely) Definitions: 1 Hard Asset (Trust-Minimized) premium Commodity (artificial material) inalienable radical digital Property 2 Future-Proof perfect Money (Internet Native) most ubiquitous and omnipresent Cryptocurrency 3 Distributed universal Ledger open standard and API (Application Programming Interface) consensually shared and synchronized database, one source of truth/validation 4 Programmatic monetary policy, programmable money narrow but powerful AI, financial singularity, an epiphany, unstoppable machine 5 First engineered monetary system in history of human race monetary Technocracy in the digital age unique Financial Invention, new phenomenon with special properties (reinvention of money) 6 Triple-Entry Accounting - info stored with many third parties analogy from Double bookkeeping(2 equal entries on opposite sides: Debit and Credit; accounts Payable &amp; Receivable) 7 Superior Monetary Network - interoperable protocol to transport value convenient way for online payment solves economic calculation problem with continuous and instant market pricing 8 Diversified index of entire world economy 9 Productive brain power of Developers (Open Source project) 10 Peaceful resistance from currency Devaluation / Depreciation 11 Modern Declaration of (monetary) Independence / Denationalization enables individual sovereignty (self-reliant communities) opt out from corrupt fiat system (silent revolution) 12 Financial Freedom technology and tool stateless and permissionless public money gives you power over money, and ultimate freedom to live on your own terms 13 New Social Contract (Novel form of Institution, BTC-Social-Contract) complex sociotechnical system decouples need for large institutions from the network 14 Pilot project on how to run society in less centralized way 15 Decentralized monetary system in network Topology but also Philosophy alternative to hierarchical structure (Bitcoin killed the King) new model with internal checks and balances (wisdom of the crowd) 16 New Global financial system (uniform metric for value) neutral form of money (not controlled by anyone) - value of neutrality the New Operating System of the Economy 17 Monetary / Economic energy from First Principles Money is an exchange of energy (Econ 101) - Henry Ford’s energy currency reduction of Entropy (Bitcoin Information Theory B.I.T.) 18 A Weapon for Peace, Not war - Financial DMZ (an Exit Strategy for Humans) war Deterrent - changes warfare from kinetic to electric energy (and critique) future war apparatus goal will be highest rate of energy-delivery(Nikola Tesla envisioned peaceful energy) 19 Education vehicle, pecuniary curiosity transcends pure money financial revelation, monetary epiphany 20 Fintech for poor people (Instrument of economic empowerment) technology bridge to abundant future 21 Fascinating (free-market) Intellectual experiment (radical thought) not to have human in charge of money persuasive idea that rewrites your mind, an inception people are inspired to contemplate / speak / write about (this blog being proof) *Genius of Bitcoin in One Sentence:“Bitcoin is a peaceful revolution about limiting the power of the modern state, ultimately to limit the effects of the Cantillon effect, allow deflation, level the playing field and make expensive and obsolete war as a means to establish who owns what*”3. Comparative Advantage3.1 SWOT analysis [C]Most Strengths &amp; Opportunities it brings are already stated.So let’s look at certain Weaknesses &amp; Threat and their explanations:Criticisms (some are unsubstantiated): 1 The protocol can be copied since it’s Open Source Network effect keeps BTC at top, also mining makes it hard to duplicate all hardware and infrastructure There are many copies and forks, both Hard and Soft, but they have little or no value and less liquidity 2 Not backed by anything Does not need external backing (has good internal properties) Based on Math and Implemented by Code Secured by Physics - Electric Power (anchored to real world with energy) Money as abstract concept partly depends on belief (Value from people using it)(agreement among people who think it’s valuable) 3 Ponzi scheme (another Tulip Mania) Is Anti-Ponzi, no pyramidal structure, and no percentage for ‘bringing’ others Everybody freely chooses to join Does not ‘promise’ high nor any returns Had speculative waves but not empty bubble, added value is digital transport of value 4 Used for criminal activities Very small percentage of transaction are illegal ones Cash is used for same purposes It is not job of money to worry how it’s being used, it’s only a tool(for crimes there is police) 5 Losing keys(password) or being stolen If want full custody than accept the risk but take all measures of precaution Otherwise keep backup with reliable third parties, or split keys with multiple subjects (MultiSig) Similar is needed with keys storage for Inheritance purposes In the long period people will learn how to keep it safe and will have more options for storage Just like today they keep cash or have a bank account, usually both 6 Consumes a lot of electricity, too demanding Utilizing energy is not a bad thing Necessary for security and decentralization Creating (good) money cannot be free Btc energy usage isn’t a problem and neither is Energy Consumption Incentive is to use cheapest energy, currently mostly from renewables (solar)also stranded from remote location (Geo-independent) that was unusable because of distance like from Island (The modern-day gold rush) Can contribute to stabilizing electric grid by reducing miners’ consumption in peak times Uses excess energy of current power plants that is otherwise just wasted Generated heat by the mining rigs could be used for heating of homes Civilization level of technological advancement is measured by amount of energy able to use(The Kardashev Scale) 7 Distribution fairness? In design it is the fairest system possible Satoshi could have come up at that time Historically Unprecedented experiment in Fair Distribution Has fair-minded issuance mechanism, miners have need to redistribute new coins Incomparably better then centralized ownership Uneven ownership not because of dishonest or unfair feature but due to risk taken by early adoptersEven today, when risk is smaller, many still afraid to buy into. As they say He Who Dares Wins! Had no premining and no initial sale Market dynamics have gradually evened Bitcoin’s distribution and will continue to do so Most equitable cryptoasset in existence Becoming more Evenly distributed over time Tends towards Normal (Gaussian) distribution, referred as Bell Curve (The Bitcoin Bell-Curve) Existing problems with respective solutions 1 Limited capacity - Inefficient, not scalable enough(currently max around 10 transaction per sec. making them slow and expensive) Blockchain Trilemma (resilience vs efficiency):/__\\ 1.Decentralisation, 2.Security, 3.Scalability Layered structureL-1 base layer optimizes around Security and Robustness, and also keeps it Decentralized(there is value in being robust)L-2 improves Scalability segment and enables Fast and Cheap transfers(Lightning Network, Liquid, Side Chains, …) 2 Not fully private, only semi-anonymous / fungibility Mixers for getting more privacy while L2 removes individual spending from main net Future potential Risks 1 Some big unknown bug gets found that breaks the network Not likely since it did not emerge for 13 years, and hackers have tried to find it Code of protocol based on formal Math theorems 2 Total collapse of Internet Highly unlikely with its decentralized nature and all redundancy Would also break current financial system since e/mobile-Banking is using web services 3 Global long term Power outage / blackout Situation possible only with some apocalyptic event when money would no longer be important 4 Breakthrough in Quantum computing implementing Shor’s algorithm that could break asymmetric cryptography Not in foreseeable future, and algorithm is just theoretical Could affect privacy of all current digital systems Already there are ideas for quantum cryptography that would solve the problem Some Critics would challenge Bitcoin on its Noninflationary nature, a subject that deserves separate paragraph.3.2 Deflation [C]– It is a decrease / drop in the general price level of goods and services. It occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0 %.Often used in Economic crisis as a scary word related to Recession and Depression.A Deflationary Spiral is a downward price reaction to an economic crisis leading to less production, lower wages, decreased demand, and falling prices.– But Deflationary economy isn’t inherently a recessionary environment at all. In fact, some of the most prosperous times of growth in history were strongly deflationary. As production becomes more efficient it is natural that prices go down. Also, Bitcoin is not formally deflationary, technically it’s programmed to be Disinflationary, rate of inflation reduces every 4 years. This result in a constant monetary base without changes to the supply.– In order to be able to spread BTC, in the beginning it had higher inflation which is reducing over time. In the long time when everybody owns and use it price would stabilize, but prior it has to rise a lot while gravitates towards zero-inflation. The problem is we live in a system that is completely opposite and based on debt. This debt must get cheaper over time with inflation, because if the opposite were true, all nations and companies would default. The issue isn’t so much deflation per se, it’s the transition from where we are now, being over leveraged, to a low-inflationary environment.– Eventually it could come to equilibrium where the value of entire money supply would match the total Economic Output of world. This allows everybody to have low time preference with long-term horizon and plan on longer period, which is good both for humans and environment. People would buy quality long-lasting stuffs, instead of buying a lot of garbage that would soon be thrown away. Instead of framing things narrowly, it allows to take a broader view, to be fearful, and make better decision. Also, in this hypothetical world there wouldn’t be extravagant hoarding that leads to macroeconomic recession. Instead, people earn in bitcoins but also spend sats according to their needs, plans and desires.– When it comes to wages even if they go down a little bit, price of goods would go down even more making person richer. The difference between nominal and real wages is fundamental. There is no point of rising nominal wages, what matters is net of inflation/deflation.On the whole Benefits outweighs the Risks significantly.– For example, image a world with independent uninflatable global currency. In last 50 years average Economic Growth has been ~ 2%, while for the next 50 years estimates are it could be around 3%. Let us take 2.5% as middle value, and with fixed supply of money it’s value should increase each year by 2.5%. In that environment you would not need to rush and spend money but can take time to think what to buy and where to invest.– Regarding credits and loans / borrowing, nominal interest rate would be low but effective one would be nominal + that 2.5%. So, credit for house could have nominal rate of 1.5% (4% effective). While investments in business, bearing more risk, would have higher rate of return or probably some share of company.Historic data: US interest rates in the last 200 years and 30 year mortgage from 1971-2022.– There is great book ’The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future’ by Jeff Boot. He suggests to stop fighting (technology driven) deflation and accept it’s potential of abundance. It would be a system where the consumers win in the form of better prices and services. Over very long time prices fall to marginal cost of production.Bitcoin Monetary Inflation chart source(declines geometrically to asymptotic max of 21 mil. - more precisely 20.999.999,9993)3.3 Other Cryptos [C]– When compared to Others crypto coins, important differences are that BTC have First Mover advantage (the Half-Truth), so is most known and almost everybody already heard about it. Then it has no leader per se so has higher decentralization and it was never hacked. Still, this does not mean that all others are worthless, some of them could have valuable additional features. Only those that are not in the same domain as BTC and target totally different use case, anything else expect base treasury asset, can survive. Of course there were, are, and will be, a lot of those that are pure scam, like OneCoin, or deceptive with pump-and-dump manipulative scheme (Greater Fool theory). Then there is crap group with stupid idea of which some are called Dino (Decentralized In Name Only). Both are in a so-called ‘shit’ coins category, or to use euphemism ‘ship’coin (sailing into oblivion). What remains is small number that could have useful purpose but even many of those will fail because of poor implementation. Just a handful will survive and thrive and maybe become leader in some domain. BTC is at the moment only one that has real chance of becoming global monetary system. Others blockchains are still solutions in search of a problem and are yet to prove themselves. If we observe competition in the cryptocurrency market it is obvious that bitcoin is the apex product of evolution.– There are several reasons why it is main One, crypto King, which includes: True Decentralization - main innovation that only BTC has for real. This is of greatest importance and PoW with all its electricity consumption gives it intrinsic worth (utility) rooted in physical world and at same time ensures temporal and spatial security (across time and space) can’t be counterfeited because it has cost in energy. while companies and their networks/platforms can be censored protocols cannot be blocked so easily. Network effect the more people use it, it’s more likely to become bigger(value increases with number of users - Metcalfe’s law) Added value with new unique features and functionality Simplistic design in its core in accordance to IT principle KISS(Keep IT Simple, Stupid) Does only one main function in the base being just money but does it very good – Some Altcoins (Alternative coins - any other then Bitcoin) could be viewed as startups where buying those is similar to investing in that company. For example DeFi - Decentralized Finance (Crypto Glossary and Acronyms) are application that replicate certain bank services. With those, investment can often be done with ICO (Initial Coin Offer), analogous to IPO (Initial Public Offer). It’s like Dot-com bubble in the 2000s where there were many companies that had website but just a few remained and grew. While bulk of others have completely failed and we never even heard about them.Still only BTC is considered (also by the SEC) as Asset (other way phrasing it Digital Property) while all others cryptos are described as Securities based on Howey Test (The Next Bitcoin is Bitcoin and All paths lead to Bitcoin). Bitcoin was not just created, but also discovered, almost like fire and wheel or number zero, and as such it is a one time event. It’s origin was organic and it is said to had an Immaculate conception which cannot be replicated. Absolute mathematical scarcity, achieved by consensus in a decentralized network, was a DISCOVERY (The One Shot Principle), while Bitcoin implementation as peer-to-peer money system was an invention from that great discovery.– Stable coins are another special category money but which is mostly centralisad, has an issues, and is pegged to a fiat currency, usually USD. Their main benefit is that they are digital and can easily be send across the globe. They are in some way a modern equivalent of eurodollar.– There are also NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) that act like prestige Collectibles (artist’s digital graphics and drawing). They have specific and limited usecase and are not in the scope of this article.3.4 Proof of Work (PoW) vs Stake [C]– Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols are another class of algorithms for consensus first invented in 2012. They work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost.Key distinction is that they are not decentralized enough, quantified by Nakamoto Coefficient, similar to Gini coefficient for inequality measure. PoS does not have incentives in line with it, also distribution is always an issue. So they can only ever be a Security equity (asset issued by body) and not Commodity alike.– PoW is Efficient and in its nature different and separate. PoW and PoS set side by side are not in the same level, it would be like comparing plain and train. For monetary system PoW is advantages and necessary. Electricity is Bitcoin’s physical property. It is also much safer against 51 % attack due to opportunity cost, too hard and too expensive.– Hardware that is doing computation for mining initially included home desktops and even laptops. Later GPU (Graphics cards) were used because of multiple coprocessor and eventually came custom build server machines called ASIC miner (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). They are much more efficient and have made regular computers obsolete for this purpose. For this reason, the algorithm has a feature called Difficulty Adjustment that is done every 2 weeks. This ensures constant time for block generation of 10 minutes, regardless of processing Hashrate (Th/s). The more power is inputted the more difficult it becomes to find the correct solution. Therefore, incentives are to have more miners when price goes up but on the other side halving makes reward smaller. Therefore it has no energy scaling issue and once equilibrium is established, reward shrinks while value is expected to rise. Additionally, miners receive a fee from each transaction. In future Transaction fees will become more important than reward. From miners’ perception Moore’s law is built into the incentive structure and lately ASIC evolution is stalling.Chart source and other mining data with hashrate info.4. Global Effects4.1 Economic impact [C]– BTC gives more Economic freedom, and it makes money SAVING simple as it should be. It brings financial tools to unBanked, underBanked and underServiced world, allowing people to become almost Bankless in traditional sense (de-bank the world). Important aspect and one of reason why entire project was successful is because of good Tokenomics - financial incentives to mine, buy, use and hold tokens.– Worth mentioning are the Economic Cycles. A phenomenon where Economy goes through boom-and-bust period that are manifested with bullish and bearish markets.There is excellent explanation by famous hedge fund manager Ray Dalio in a video - How the Economic machine worksIn it he gave few simple advice, 3 rules of thumbs: 1. Don’t have Debt rise faster than Income 2. Don’t have Debt rise faster than Productivity 3. Do all that you can to raise your Productivity– Regarding the Cycles we find them also in Bitcoin short history, each lasting around 4 years, approximately halving period. Each next cycle has been less volatile, since larger market cap makes it harder to swing, and was also hyped in certain moments. In prior periods it was correlated with Nasdaq index and still is partially. However, lately dissociation from correlation with equities may indicate that widespread bitcoin adoption is accelerating, while stagflation may be the underlying fundamental factor driving bitcoin adoption.– In the last 10 years we could see value goes up (as the previous chart shows) several times by order of magnitude. Waves were created either by big whales or small retail investors as more people become Bitcoiners. Whales are considered those who have 1000+ bitcoins. Others gathered around online community WallSteetBets (with famous GameStop saga) on reddit, so called Ape movement.On the other side it had gone down the same way. Additionally recent crash was caused by collapse of overleveraged and unregulated companies that were investing and lending cryptos. Some of them were exposed to others and it was like contagion created by gambling. To point out few of those: Tera-Luna, Anchor, 3 Arrow Capital, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, FTX. They either went bankruptcy (financial defaulted) or were liquidated. Crypto market has repeated mistakes from 2008 crisis. But here market was cleared of bad players. And it was not the first time, some might remember Mt.Gox going under, also Coincheck hack and BitConnect scam.– Bitcoin as a new asset class gain incredible popularity. When it comes to total market cap at some point was 1 Trillion dollars, while entire crypto market was around 2 T. It took Google 22 years to become 1 T company, While Bitcoin got there in 12 years. Tradeable Gold market is about 5 trillion. For it to catch up would mean value jumping 20 times (educated guess) from current price. Note that entire stock market is around 100 T, while real estates are 300 T.Bitcoin in average had growth of little over 100 % yearly (price doubling each year) for a decade (2012-2022), so it was the best performing asset.4.2 Political implications [C]– Inflating currency supply distorts the money and equals creating more imaginary products which negatively affects the markets. Central planning (of money also) goes against evolution, one of the reasons it always fails.Monetarism - emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation.Before bitcoin we have never had an incorruptible monetary base layer. World needs a Neutral (reserve) currency, now more than ever.– Blockchain can give more direct democracy. Technology enables higher rate of participation in voting, making referendums also easier to carry out.– Looking into the history, Worst Hyperinflations, of all time were during the last century in: -Hungary, -Yugoslavia, -Germany, -Greece.Some well-known examples of big inflation since 2000s:-Hyper: Zimbabwe (million+ %), Venezuela (10,000 %), Ghana, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, …-High: Lebanon(200+ %), Argentina (70 %), Turkey (80 %), etc.-Moderate: USA, UK, EU, and others– Since is it hard/impossible to ban bitcoin globally, countries can ignore it or try to regulate it. Some countries have more accepting laws while other have restricting ones. For example, China has ban mining, as bitcoin can interfere and jeopardize their central influence on population. They might be the first to implement CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) which would give even more power to the Surveillance State. This would allow easier spread of Social Credit System, an unacceptable dystopia. So, Bitcoin can facilitate reduction of government ability to track and monitor its citizens. As David Chaum said: “Privacy in messaging and payments, and the like, is so fundamental to democracy.”– On the other side more democratic countries have embraced and made it legal but require KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering). So, most exchanges have to be in Compliance with these rules and ask user for Identity documents. Still there are some DEXs (Decentralized exchanges) that can circumvent these requirements.– At the moment countries have varying range of attitudes towards bitcoin. Those more friendly ones have legalized it in a way to be either accepted (US, EU,…), or non taxable (Portugal as prominent with residency for Digital Nomads including ‘Bitcoin family’), or even legal tender (El Salvador first one; El Zonte - Bitcoin Beach). Both Miami and New York City now have Bitcoin-friendly mayors. On the other side are more skeptical ones still waiting to see where it goes.– Regarding legality ground there is interesting segment of the US Constitution, Article I - Section 10, where it forbids states from issuing “bills” (promissory notes) but gold and silver coin can be used as legal “tender”. So if bitcoin would be considered analogous to gold it might be used as legal tender by default (talk with attorney Aaron Daniel).– Btc is hope for many people who are in despair and marginalized. One of use cases is to give freedom to people in countries under some sanction like Cuba, Iran, etc. It can also help refugees escape conflict zones and leave (with their saving) from Libya, Russia, Ukraine, Syria, etc. Same is true for those fleeing oppressive and tyrannical regimes. Bitcoin and revolutionary blockchain technology give a new paradigm of economy with no territory that supersedes regular borders.– Next to mention that many African countries have very weak (high inflating) currency, in which a lot of impoverished people don’t have access to financial services. Some are even using foreign issued post-colonial money, namely CFA Franc that is still controlled by the French treasury. So Open Source code is fighting monetary colonialism as well, as described by Alex Gladstein.-In El Salvador, where remittance fees and exchange rates can eat away a money transfer to family, Bitcoin offered lower fees and faster transactions.-In Cuba, after a dual-currency system devalued the peso, those who saved in Bitcoin managed to stay afloat.-In Nigeria, human rights activists depend on Bitcoin for donations after crackdowns by authoritarian regimes.– It’s now obvious that Supremacy of the Petrodollar Economy is Waning and its unnatural hegemony coming to an end. This will probably lead to decentralized multipolar multi-reserve system. Artificially strong dollar is not good even for US, since it makes export hard which leads to less local production. Interesting book and another video presentation is ‘Changing world order’ - by Ray Dalio where he talks about China economic rise. But China also manipulates currency a lot. One could make analogy from fiat based military industrial complex to crypto industrial complex based on energy.– CB could be gone in its current form, even fiat could be backed by Bitcoin or central government reduced in that regard. Essentially removing monetary power and leave only fiscal policy. According to Thiers’ Law: Good Money Drives Out Bad (opposite of Gresham’s Law).– The politics of bitcoin underpins its social life.4.3 Social component [C]– As the ecosystem grew, many diverse subgroups have joined the movement.Initially it started with crypto OG (Original Gangster) a slang for developer or founder of early crypto blockchain.Then came anonymous, libertarians, conservatives, progressives, entrepreneurs, VCs (Venture Capitalist - investors), miners, traders, etc. It was not singular ethos but had many heterogeneous Subcommunities where everyone saw something of interest that suits them. It was like wide rebel alliance with extreme diversity. Some are often referred as ‘True Bitcoiners’, a forerunners of movement and ideology. It is similar to term Bitcoin Maximalist (Btc Maxi), meaning those who promote only Bitcoin. There was some toxicity in the public space, that could be filtered. Maybe best label would be BTC Realist or simple a Bitcoiner.Still be aware that ‘Bitcoin is not smooth jazz, Bitcoin is punk rock: deal with it!’, as explained by Andreas Antonopoulos. That means you can’t control it, centralise it, turn its disruptive elements into something suitable for an executive board room, or rename it ‘blockchain’ to make it more palatable for adoption.– In philosophic sense there is also Bitcoin Minimalism (Create more, consume less - as explained by Dan Held), which is contrary to consumerism. In political arena it had brought together all from opposite spectrum and reduced polarization. In addition, since its wide adoption has just started all those who don’t have any amount of bitcoin yet or are against it are called No-Coiners.– One of the reasons it takes time for adopting is that people first need to learn and understand it. Most schools teach very little about finances and even less about money itself. Governments have no interest to fully educate citizens, it’s easier for them when less people see inflation as indirect tax.And most people themselves are lazy in a way and don’t care too much about monetary system. They’ve preferred way to outsource responsibility to the Government, but as result end up being dependent and completely relying on institutions.There are those who say Bitcoin philosophy is like a Religion (Gospel of prophet Satoshi :), for all good and bad that the term carries with it. Although one could find few similar elements, important distinction is that there are no dogmas, and nobody is above criticism. What is in common is preach and practice of people who keep spirit and ethos of it. Passionate supporters are sometimes called Bitcoin believers / evangelist for being optimistic about success of the project. They firmly hold their stance and vocally assert their opinion to the crowd. For some it represents monetary enlightenment and finacial renaissance almost on a spiritual level (spiritual awakening from fiat sleep).– Yet many at first experience can feel Cognitive dissonance. It is an unpleasant mental conflict that occurs for an individual when assumptions or beliefs are contradicted by new information. In this case defense mechanisms include rejecting the claim or ignoring the new information all together. For anyone involved in Bitcoin, alignment of beliefs to behaviors is tested regularly.– Once a person gets enough information and after a while it clicks in the mind. There is an expression used to describe it:‘Taking The Orange Pill’ analogy from movie Matrix.– Today’s Overconsumption Society is not sustainable in the long run. Investing in Bitcoin is reducing consumptions of short lifetime consumer goods, that end up in landfills. Society should change its buying habits since planet resources are not unlimited. Also, production should aim for durability, and not have planned obsolescence. Issue in not about having growth, it’s about efficiency, how to get more for less. This fundamentally changes how our economy functions.– Because of broken monetary system, excess value flows to top. That is one of the reasons there are many billionaires while others have to work 60h a week just to make ends meet. Instead, higher productivity could allow most people to have 30h week (automation could free time for more human creativity).5. Looking Forward5.1 Future Development [C]Roadmap– It is nothing less than a miracle that the project the survived and took off. Already 13 years in action uninterrupted, had not stopped for a second and it gained a lot of traction. In the first half of last decade, it was unknown to wide public, used only by enthusiasts, and also was very uncertain. Although still in early to mid-stage we can say that the biggest hurdles are behind. It is running flawlessly and is absolutely thriving in adoption.We can identify Crypto ecosystem as new cultural and economic trend that started from forum, spread through Reddit and Twitter into fabric of social circle. This created condition under which broader Adoption occurred.– Internet evolution led from pure data and communication to social information and digital value. In that regard this next steep of scientific evolution is standing on the shoulders of giants. Just like open flow of information, enabled by the internet, made the world a better place, the open flow of value with bitcoin will make it even better.– Although it has the power to disrupt banking and monetary industry, we can look at it more as a transformative technology that will improve and augment it. Only time will unlock its full potential. Firstly, it was a cool leapfrog technology, and later it became something like investment, sort of digital gold - Store of Value and that’s where we are now. Later if it becomes universally adopted it will be Medium of Exchange. That would probably lead to also serving as Unit of Account. These would be The 3 Phases of Bitcoin Mass Adoption.– In the long run idea is for it to become regular everyday payment service, to fully realize function as Medium of Exchange (or metaphorically Medium of Expression). For this to happen it needs good integration with second layer lightning protocol for scalability. Once it grows large enough it will become stable which enables it then to be also Unit of Account. If this happens it will likely become Global Reserve Asset, Bitcoin Standard, a hypothesis explained in the book ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ by Saifedean Ammous.– As people adopt it in many countries, regulatory will follow to make it like foreign currency, meaning no capital gain tax. Since nobody controls it, it is also easier for all countries, including world superpowers, to use for international clearing since they will not depend on the competition. In that case it’s value could rise to few hundred thousand in several years, even reaching a million in 10 to 20 years. Jeff Booth calls that hyperbitcoinization or a Hyper-Bitcoinized World(YT).– Banks will also have their role in this new world. They are slow with change because of compliance requirements, but eventually those that survive will adapt and compete in the industry.Some will offer custody services (bitcoin based banks) with full reserves and proof of it. Others will become lightning hubs and they will help scale payments. Also giving loans will remain a service that would need a financial entity to verify one’s employment or collateral for example. New era of free banking to some extent.One expectation is that Bitcoin main layer will be used for settlement between countries and also banks, like GIRO transfer, RTGS and Swift are today, but just much better.– As Adoption increases, volatility will go down. Widespread crypto adoption is pushed by millennials, a younger tech-savvy generations, that are turning into adults. People are usually afraid of new things they do not understand, so they need first to learn how to handle it safely.Rate of adoption is following S curve and gaining speed (just like the internet did):5.2 What lies ahead [C]– First, it’s important to learn as much and have all-encompassing understanding of it all. Since this system is not forced but is voluntary Opt-In (freely choose to use it / be involved and possibly make better world) just learning about it is already a contribution. Next then comes playing with it and later promote the idea by teaching others around you (it’s virtuous to teach people). There is a famous meme (rapidly spread cultural element): LaserEyes - significant focus on important thing that can make a difference.Secondly decide if you want to buy some, for now as an investment and later as a Savings Accounts. This way you will try it yourself and learn a few things. Install one or few of recommended wallets (such as Phoenix, Breez, Muun, Blue Wallet), register on exchange, withdraw funds to your wallet (take off exchanges).– When most countries join the system, they will even compete who has better adoption. Eventually their CBs will start acquiring Bitcoin as part of their reserves. Once first large CB acquires it others will be forced to follow it based on game theory. Private Banks would also own BTC as reserve asset. As it continues to mature it will gain wider support (Lindy effect), integrate into the real world, and go Mainstream which could be beneficial for everyone.– Currently in 2022 around 200 million people (4 % of world’s population) are estimated to have same amount of bitcoin/sats. Every big change need time, in this case decades. It’s not something that can happen overnight, as people have to learn and accept it. For most persons it was outside of their world view (mental model).– Some expectation is that by 2030 1 billion people will have btc wallets. In over 100 countries it would be regulated like foreign currency, while in 10 at least accepted as legal tender.5.3 Practical Approach [C]– In broad sense Investment plan includes first to inform yourself, do your homework. Second to decide what amount is at your disposal for investing. Lastly to split it based on your risk appetite among several classes of asset. At an early-stage risk was much higher and in accordance with maxim: Invest only what you can afford to lose. Now it is less risky than in the last decade but still it is considered relatively riskier class, mainly because of large up and down swings. But now there is now an opposite saying: Only buy Bitcoin with the money you can’t afford to lose (in the long period).Only if you become convinced enough into the Bitcoin story is it good idea to invest.–In practice there are several generally useful strategies (one or more can be used): 1. Move (reallocate) a part of your portfolio into Btc and keep it long term  - size of part could range from 5 to 20 % depending on one’s net worth and risk appetite  - don’t made a mistake not investing anything in order not to have FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)  - decide when to join the train and potentially build generation wealth 2. Make monthly savings into Bitcoin (for example 3 - 5 % of your salary / income)  - accumulate slowly with average price (dollar cost averaging) 3. Do not sell in bear market when it falls down  - hold tight during periods the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt)  - happy HODLing (meme variation of Hold; Hold On for Dear Life), stay humble and stack Sats 4. Active (daily) trading would not be advisable since it not productive activity  - very hard to beat the market, even with technical analysisAdditional ways to contribute:-Consider starting to accept payments in Bitcoin for the work/service you or your company provide-You can even give some small discount when someone pays with BTC, it will incentivize others to use it-In later stage use it for payments wherever possible-Change mentality from Buying and Selling to Earning/Saving and Spending/UsingSuggestions:– Maintain an emergency cash cushion, enough to pay all your bills for one full year. By holding bitcoin and cash you protect yourself both from inflation in the long term and from volatility in the short period.– On the other hand, if you have no cash cushion, if you use leverage, if you lend Bitcoin for interest, if you use Bitcoin as loan collateral, if you short Bitcoin, or try to time the market in any way it’s gambling. Gambling with any expectation of coming out ahead is foolish. And, as the saying goes: Fools and their money are soon parted. Don’t gamble if you want to become wealthy. Instead, become a patient, cold-blooded (fearless) long term holder of Bitcoin.– Think in long-term, become wise saver and prudent investor in this new landscape since it is ultimate savings technology. Treat it like your savings account.– Safeguard yourself, especially from YouTube comment section under every crypto related video clip. They are full of so-called trading strategy experts with some fake name and WhatsApp number for contact (#ScamAlert - stay away)– Bitcoin market, by nature, is not highly efficient because not all the stakeholders have same knowledge. It has interesting game theory of Information asymmetry.New people coming in don’t have same information as those who have been here. They play the game of economic coordination differently. Also human behavior in finance is often irrational and most people do not evaluate risk correctly. They are bias towards gains but still have Loss Aversion: The aggravation in losing money seems greater than the pleasure of gaining the same amount.As for those interested in trading between cycles be aware of 80-20 Rule (Pareto principle)– Popular crypto Exchanges (places to buy Bitcoin):Kraken, Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini, KuCoin, …– There are also decentralized ones and in person marketplaces like:Bisq, HodlHodl, RoboSats– Concerning Bitcoin price prediction there are some interesting graphs, according to which we are currently in a good period to buy in.(but don’t forget that every assumption about future is a probability bet)-Logarithmic price chart:-Rainbow chart:5.4 Recapitulation [C]– Money systems have changed through history and current one has mayor flaw, it being centralized and having too much power in single place. That inevitably leads to corruption which ultimately results in high inflation, so we can say it is broken. Also, as permissioned system it is over controlling. Reason it was tolerated is that it was the best that existed at the time. But with new time come new technology that enabled better systems. From Store of Value perspective, it should have lowest possible inflation. In this regard Bitcoin is in simple words just better money (Superior SoV) and overall good if we apply moral and ethical framework to it.– Hyperinflation and currency collapses are not exceptionally rare events. In fact, the average lifespan of a fiat currency is only about 35 years, which means these events happen much more frequently than many people realize. When viewed from civilization perspective we want value to last minimum our lifetime, better even longer for inheritance. Also, many of societal problems arise from money, so fixing the money could improve the world, in part at least (meme: Bitcoin Fixes this!). Money should be a Fiduciary system - legally and ethically bound to act in clients/users’ best interest and ahead of their own, duty to preserve good faith and trust.– Bitcoin’s ultimate goal should be to enable all of us to think colectively less about money, and more about other things that we are intereted in, to enrich human experience. Otherwise everybody would have to be full time investor or speculator, or just spend money as fast as possible.– As a Conclusion hope that this comprehensive review can arouse your curiosity and elevate critical thinking.
