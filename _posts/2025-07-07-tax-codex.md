Taxes are usually [disliked](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/common-sense-science/202504/we-hate-paying-taxes){:target="_blank"} (by [Americans](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/){:target="_blank"} especially), and mostly boring; but still very important and relevant, both for single person and for broader community.  
One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be informed about it.  
And to mention that taxes enable society to function on a large scale, to manage shared resources and cover for the costs.  
Some things can Not be built and used individually, it is not practical nor efficient, because of scale and logistics.  
This includes public infrastructure, such as roads, and in some cases also Hospitals and Schools assuming there are public ones.  
Civic society organizes itself as a country of citizens or a nation state.  
And always remember that Function of all government services is to serve the people and community, so never forget that politicians are your servants (employees) and not master.

Next important issue is the level of taxes, different kinds and types, and their complexity but how they are implemented and controlled/enforced.
Firstly, obviously it can't be 0 nor 100%.  
Secondly, some consider reasonable to be in range from 10 to 50% (marginal tax rate).  
10% or 1/10 (one tenth) was often a historic norm from the past.  
Half or 100%, or 50/50 model is a common concept of fairness.  
Higher than 50% is counterproductive as most people would be discouraged to work when the state takes too much or their income (motivation and incentive matters).  
Another issue with too high taxes is that people stop paying it and start actively working to avoid them - The Laffer Curve (optimal tax rate that maximizes government revenue).  
More centar stance would be to have them in ranges between 20 and 40% (20% 1/5 should cover 80% of people).  
Different countries, depending on culture and economic development, could have different limit, or Tiers so to say.
