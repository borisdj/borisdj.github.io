**Tax codex standardised protocol for long-term stability**

Taxes are usually disliked, and mostly boring; but still very important and relevant, both for single person and for the community.  
One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be informed about it.  
Just mention that taxes enables society to function on large scale, to manage shared resources and cover for the costs.  
Some things can Not be build and used individually, it is not practical nor efficienly, because of scale and logistics.  
This includes public infrastructure, such as roads, and in some cases also Hospitals and Schools assuming there are public ones.  
Civic society ogranise itself as a country of citizens or a nation state.  
And always remember that Function of all goverment services is to serve the people and community, so never forget that politicians are your servants (employees) and not master.
