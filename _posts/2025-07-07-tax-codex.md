**Tax coded as standardized protocol for long-term stability of country's budget**

&nbsp; Taxes are mostly boring and usually [disliked](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/common-sense-science/202504/we-hate-paying-taxes){:target="_blank"} (especially by [Americans](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/){:target="_blank"}), but still are very important and relevant, both for single person and for broader community. One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be informed about it.  
Next to mention that taxes enable society to function on a large scale, to manage shared resources and cover for the costs. Some things can not be built and used individually, it is not practical nor efficient, because of scale and logistics. This includes public infrastructure, such as roads, and in some cases also Hospitals and Schools assuming there are public ones.  
&nbsp; Civic society organizes itself as a country of citizens or a nation state. And always remember that Function of all government services is to serve the people and community, so never forget that politicians are your servants (employees) and not master.

&nbsp; Next important issue is the level of taxes, different kinds and types, and their complexity but how they are implemented and controlled/enforced. Firstly, obviously it can't be 0 nor 100%. Secondly, some consider it reasonable to be in the range from 10 to 50% (marginal tax rate).  
10% or 1/10 (one tenth) was often a historic norm from the past. Half or 100%, or 50/50 model is a common concept of fairness. Higher than 50% is counterproductive as most people would be discouraged to work when the state takes too much or their income (motivation and incentive matters), so up to 50% can be considered as Fair (marginal tax rate should [not exceed 50%](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1idyebs/cmv_income_marginal_tax_rates_should_never_exceed/){:target="_blank"}).  
&nbsp; Another issue with too high taxes is that people stop paying it and start actively working to avoid them - [**The Laffer Curve**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp){:target="_blank"} (optimal tax rate that maximizes government revenue). More centar stance would be to have them in ranges between 20 and 40% (20% or 1/5 should cover 80% of people).   
Different countries, depending on culture and economic development, could have different limits, or Tiers so to say.

&nbsp;In general, the tax model should be [Progressive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp){:target="_blank"} ([how good is it](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/1g4vfd1/is_progressive_taxation_really_a_good_thing/){:target="_blank"}), with a higher rate for higher income, but still having maximum limit to be widely acceptable (having precise Highest and Lowest Bracket).  
One could ask why such a model, 2 reasons: first is a more philosophical argument with emphasis on humanity and solidarity (progress of civilisation), and second is for better social cohesion including a more productive population (healthy and satisfied people are more fruitful).
In a political-economic sense this would be a capitalist system with a moderate level of social democracy - history shows that this is most stable in the long run.  
&nbsp; Tax types: corporate, personal on income capital gains (dividends and etc.). VAT, Wealth.
I want to focus on income and gains tax as they are most direct and relevant. VAT is also somewhat important, while Wealth tax is hard to enforce and not worth it.
Then there is also an inheritance tax, that in some countries is levied only above a certain threshold and within a reasonable range (say from 5 to 20 %).  
For example in Switzerland it is not on federal level but cantonal, and applies only above 1 million CHF, and goes from 1 to 7%. On the other hand, the US and UK have a top rate of up to 40%.

**EXAMPLE** of Tax Brackets:  

| â„–  | To Amount | Model S | Model M | Model L |
| -  | --------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| 1  |    20 000 |  0 %    |  0 %    |  5 %    |
| 2  |    50 000 | 10 %    | 15 %    | 15 %    |
| 3  |   100 000 | 20 %    | 25 %    | 25 %    |
| 4  |   500 000 | 25 %    | 30 %    | 35 %    |
| 5  | 1 000 000 | 30 %    | 40 %    | 50 %    |

Tax Models : S - Smaller; M - Medium; L - Larger

In the case of total Yearly Tax from gross income of 130 K in Model M:  
20,000 * 0 + 30,000 * 15% + 50,000 * 25% + 100,000 * 30% = 23,000 (effective rate around 18%)

Focus should be on sustainability and stability, with balanced budget and long-term planning.
That is whay this would be consider as a Protocol.
Also tax changes would be planned well in advace and know to exeryonce waht to expect and if need plan accordingly.
On the technical side, tax rules should be simple, and percentages round () with only few steps, like 2% or 5%.
There sould exist several standardized tiers, and distinct situations, and societies with different stages of development, but also specific culture and history.
Still in the long term, all should aim towards more unified range, and humans values should be universal, and it would make stable, also with lees issues for tax avaidance using ofshore heavens.
