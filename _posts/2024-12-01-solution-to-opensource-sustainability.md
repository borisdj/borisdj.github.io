excerpt: "proposal to fix the 'broken' OS"
---

Open Source is a great concept and excellent way for making Software more accessible and usable.  
It gives everyone better availability for testing and debugging, bug fixes and suggestions for improvements, and overall contributions with PR (PullRequest) - GitHub collaboration.  
But lately that model often have problems due to some business practices.  
Some even say that Open Source is Broken.  
So following proposal is one attempt to find a fix.  

First issue is that even big projects depends mostly on one main developer or just a few contributors.  
At the same time library/package or application can have several million users, both private and legal entities, either for free or commercial products.  
And often maintenance becomes very time consuming and practically requires a full time job.  
Still it ends up relying mostly on enthusiasm of author and their good will, since there is never enough donations nor financial suport from the big companies.  
This then puts high pressure on the author, either to burn out or abandon the project, creating sustainability.  
This also represents a risk to all the users since they would lose support with no easy replacement.  

Second concern is that large corporation are profiting significantly from many OS software while giving back very litle or non at all.  
They take dozens of OS software and encapsulate it into a commercial app and some of them make large revenues.  
Which is fine as such but there should be a path to have them pay their fair share to the Devs.  
Categorical imperative in this case would be those who profits the most should give something back from all the value they are getting with their business in the industry (Pareto Principle in business model).  

So idea it to have 2 categories of OS project depending hardship of maintenance.
- First group would be fully free, default for smaller projects that do not require significant time and efforts. Besides initial development, later would need only occasional updates.  
- Second for larger and complex ones where it becomes burden to developer. Adn if needed they should be encourages to switch to these types of license and also all project that are from start made in such manner are to be welcomed into the OpenSource community.  
Criticism without effective solutions are not useful nor justified.  
One constructive  idea that is getting traction is to make it mostly free while keeping it the source open.  
'Mostly free' means Free (of charge) for majority of users.
Here is a distinction between Free (of charge) and Free/Libre camps ([FLOSS and FOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html){}).
Even the paid ones should have simple progressive pricing tiers with rounded amount (do not use amont such as 799, plain 800 is just fine).  
I call this **cFOSS** - *conditionally Free and OpenSource Software*.  
Note that this is not like source Available that essentially only allowes for code to be read and nothing else.  
Instead Openness is retained with freedom to use the code, modify it and distribute it as a dependency.  
This enables/creates sustainability and ensures project survies in the long term.  
It gives positive incentives adn creates self-reinforcing positive loop.  
And even the paid ones should have simple progressive pricing tiers with rounded amount (don no use 999, plain 1000 is just fine).
