excerpt: "proposal to fix the 'broken' OS"
---

Open Source is a great concept and excellent way for making Sofware more accessible and usable.
It gives everzone better availabilitz for testing, debuging, bug fixes with contibutions PullRequest, sugggestions for improvments etc.
But lately that model often have problems due to some business practices.
Some even say that Open Source is Broken.
So following proposal is one attempt to find a fix.

First issue is that even big projects depends mostly on one main developer or just a few contributors.
At the same time library/package or application can have several milion users, both private and legal entities. for free or commercial procuts.
And often maintenance becomes very time consuming and practically requires a full time job.
Still it ends up relying mostly on enthusiasm of author and their good will, since there is never enough donations nor financial  suport from the big companies.
This then puts high pressure on the author, either to burn out or abandon the project, creating sustainability.
This also represents a risk to all the users since they would lose support with no easy replacement.

Second concern is that large coorporeation are profitng significatly from manz OS project while giving back litle to the community.
They take doyens of OS softawer encapsutalte it inta a commercial app and make a lot of money.
Which is fine as such but there should be a path to have them pay fair share to the devs.
Meaning those who profits the most give something back from all the value they are getting with their business in the industry (Pareto Principle in business model)

-Still one category that can remain fully free is for smaller project do not required significan time and efforts
- But all those larger ones where it becomes burden to developer should be encourages to switch to these types of license and also all project that are from start made in manner are to be welcomed into OpenSource community.
Criticism only wihtout effective solutions are not useful nor justified.
One constructive  idea that is getting traction is to make it mostly free while keeping it the source open.
Mostly free  means Free (of charge) for mayority of users.
Even the paid ones should have simple progresive pricing tiers with rounded amount (don no use 999, plain 1000 is just fine).
I call this cFOSS - conditionally Free and OpenSource Software.
Note that this is not like source available that essentialy only allowes for code to be read and nothing else.
Instead Openness is retained with freedom to use the code, modify it and distribute it as a dependency.
This enables/creates sustainability and ensures project survies in the long term.
And even the paid ones should have simple progresive pricing tiers with rounded amount (don no use 999, plain 1000 is just fine).
