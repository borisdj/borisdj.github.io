Following text will explain some best practice ways to use G-Sheets, with advance features and process integration.  
Focus will be on standardized approach with SQL Database alike structure, using [Third Normal Form](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/third-normal-form){:target="_blank"} ([3NF normalization - yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFQaEYEc8_8){:target="_blank"}).  
Importance of standardization is emphasized in the Title with words ***Tabelaris Protocollum***, a latin variation which means *Table Protocol*.  
With emphasis on how to design it optimally, and efficient method to organise and normalise data.  
Normalized data has improved Integrity, reduced Redundancy and is easier for Maintenance.  
Many of its capabilities will be displayed with real-life example of each usage.  

Firstly, when compared with Excel (from Microsoft) we can shortly list pros and cons.
* Advantages:  
--Natively web based so somewhat better in that sense  
  Easier remote access from different device and simple sharing data for collaborative work.  
  (Excel does have 365 version that can work in browser and have similar features but is more suitable for corporate users.  
--Straightforward  and more versatile intergration with other Google services:  
  (Docs[text], Gmail[email], Drive[storage] - a Big Plus)  
* Disdvantages:  
--Scalability limits for large data  
  (10 million cells limit per sheet, but slow with more then 100 000 rows, 10-20 columns.  
--Privacy issue - mostly fixed with 2FA (2-Factor-Authentification) login.
