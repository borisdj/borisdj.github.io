**Tax coded as standardized protocol for long-term stability of country's budget**

&nbsp; Taxes are mostly boring and usually [disliked](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/common-sense-science/202504/we-hate-paying-taxes){:target="_blank"} (especially by [Americans](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/){:target="_blank"}), but still are very important and relevant, both for single person and for broader community. One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be informed about it.  
Next to mention that taxes enable society to function on a large scale, to manage shared resources and cover for the costs. Some things can not be built and used individually, it is not practical nor efficient, because of scale and logistics. This includes public infrastructure, such as roads, and in some cases also Hospitals and Schools assuming there are public ones.  
&nbsp; Civic society organizes itself as a country of citizens or a nation state. And always remember that Function of all government services is to serve the people and community, so never forget that politicians are your servants (employees) and not master.

&nbsp; Next important issue is the level of taxes, different kinds and types, and their complexity but how they are implemented and controlled/enforced. Firstly, obviously it can't be 0 nor 100%. Secondly, some consider it reasonable to be in the range from 10 to 50% (marginal tax rate).  
10% or 1/10 (one tenth) was often a historic norm from the past. Half or 100%, or 50/50 model is a common concept of fairness. Higher than 50% is counterproductive as most people would be discouraged to work when the state takes too much or their income (motivation and incentive matters), so up to 50% can be considered as Fair (marginal tax rate should [**not exceed 50%**](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1idyebs/cmv_income_marginal_tax_rates_should_never_exceed/){:target="_blank"}).  
&nbsp; Another issue with too high taxes is that people stop paying it and start actively working to avoid them - [**The Laffer Curve**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp){:target="_blank"} (optimal tax rate that maximizes government revenue). More centar stance would be to have them in ranges between 20 and 40% (20% or 1/5 should cover 80% of people).   
Different countries, depending on culture and economic development, could have different limits, or Tiers so to say.

&nbsp; In general, the tax model should be [**Progressive**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp){:target="_blank"} ([how good is it](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/1g4vfd1/is_progressive_taxation_really_a_good_thing/){:target="_blank"}), with a higher rate for higher income, but still having maximum limit to be widely acceptable (having precise Highest and Lowest Bracket).  
One could ask why such a model, 2 reasons: first is a more philosophical argument with emphasis on humanity and solidarity (progress of civilisation), and second is for better social cohesion including a more productive population (healthy and satisfied people are more fruitful).
In a political-economic sense this would be a capitalist system with a moderate level of social democracy - history shows that this is most stable in the long run.  
&nbsp; Tax types: corporate, personal on income capital gains (dividends and etc.). VAT, Wealth.
I want to focus on income and gains tax as they are most direct and relevant. VAT is also somewhat important, while Wealth tax is hard to enforce and not worth it.
Then there is also an inheritance tax, that in some countries is levied only above a certain threshold and within a reasonable range (say from 5 to 20 %).  
One example is Switzerland where it is not on federal level but cantonal, and applies only above 1 million CHF, and goes from 1 to 7%. On the other hand, the US and UK have a top rate of up to 40%.
To keep things Simple as possible (KISS principle) ther should be minimal difference betwean Income and Capital Tax, so that there is not deistortion of one or the another segment. This in practice could mean that there tax tiers should be simmilar if not the same, while Social and Pension and Medical insurance should have max limit that can be mandatory, with anything above to be optional.
Few other countiers thas could be taken into consideration for comparative analysus include: Geramany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, UAE, Singapore.

**EXAMPLE** of Tax Brackets  
(US average value, should be scaled to each country and specific currency):  

| â„–  | To Amount | Step  | Model S | Model M | Model L |
| -  | --------: | ----: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| 1  |    20 000 |  20 K |  0 %    |  0 %    |  5 %    |
| 2  |    50 000 |  30 K | 10 %    | 15 %    | 15 %    |
| 3  |   100 000 |  50 K | 20 %    | 25 %    | 25 %    |
| 4  |   500 000 | 400 K | 25 %    | 30 %    | 35 %    |
| 5  |     Above |     - | 30 %    | 40 %    | 50 %    |

Tax Models : S - Smaller; M - Medium; L - Larger

For example, with gross income of 130 K, total Yearly Tax in model M would be:  
20,000 * 0 + 30,000 * 15% + 50,000 * 25% + 30,000 * 30% = 26,000 (effective rate 20%)

&nbsp; Focus should be on sustainability and stability, with balanced budget and long-term planning. That is whay this would be consider as a **Protocol**.
On the technical side, tax rules should be simple, and percentages round () with only few steps, like 2% or 5%. There sould exist several standardized tiers, and distinct situations, and societies with different stages of development, but also specific culture and history.  
Still in the long term, all countries should aim towards more unified ranges, and humans values should be universal, and it would make stable, also with lees issues for tax avaidance using ofshore heavens.

&nbsp; Tax marginal rate limits (e.g. min 15%, max 45%) should be set with constitutional law so that it needs a supermajority (2/3) of parliament for change. While in that range different models could be changed with simple majority but this should not become regular practices, only if not absolutely needed. Any change should be publicly discussed and debated, also planned in advance with any effects calculated into a model.  
&nbsp; Another interesting idea is to have this Law, but also other laws and regulation to be on Github repository that has excellent visibility, transparent procedure for update, and detailed history of changes - audit info and track record. This was tried in Washington DC with authoritative [digital source laws](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/){:target="_blank"}).  
In this regard, laws themself could have conditional expiration, say 50 years (with exception to consitutional laws), after which they should be reviewed, and discarded if obsolete or renewed(confirmed) with optional amendments. This would help to keep regulation smaller and effective, and at the same time gives each generation a direct chance to express their stance and opinion about matters in question.

&nbsp; Lastly, government spending is important as well. The idea that fiscal responsibility is absolutely irrelevant is total nonsense. Real economy, as well as resources and production, natural limits. Also taxes need to be public and broad support for citizens. Last few decades we all have witnessed ever growing deficits, with debt ballooning and money printing overuse, and even with all still having smaller investment in public infrastructure, and growing wealth gaps (due to lower taxes, and higher inflation that acts as a regressive tax).  
&nbsp; In addition, when there is too much corruption, and if money from the  budget is wasted on unproductive things, or allocated unproductively, then people would not see the point in paying their fair share to society. And if the system is efficient, with all children have good schools then people would not oppose a slighter higher taxes, and most would willingly pay it, as they know it has a good purpose with noble cause.  
Still one should stay cautious, as public companies over a long time are prone to corruption. So either to have multiple strong checks and balances, and/or have more private sector and contractors, while keeping transparency in public procurement and fair tenders, equal for all participants. Finding and maintaining a delicate balance in such dynamics required dedication and constant work.
