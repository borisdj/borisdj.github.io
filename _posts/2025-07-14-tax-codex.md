**Tax coded as standardized protocol for long-term budget stability**

![/tax-codex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisdj/borisdj.github.io/main/assets/images/tax-codex/tax-codex.jpg)

&nbsp; Taxes are mostly boring and usually [disliked](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/common-sense-science/202504/we-hate-paying-taxes){:target="_blank"} (especially by [Americans](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/){:target="_blank"}), but still are very important and relevant, both for individual person and for the broader community. One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be educated about it and have an informed opinion.  
&nbsp; Next to mention that taxes enable society to function at large, to manage shared resources and cover for the costs. Some things can not be built and used individually, it is not practical nor efficient, because of scale and logistics. This includes public infrastructure, such as roads and city installations for water and electricity, and in some cases also Hospitals and Schools assuming there are public ones. Also there are costs of maintaining those facilities and institutions.  
&nbsp; Civil society organizes itself as a country of citizens or a nation state. Always remember that the function of all Government Services is to **serve** the people and community, and never forget that politicians are your employees (servants) and not masters.

&nbsp; Next important issue is the level of taxes and their complexity, as well as how they are implemented and controlled/enforced. Firstly, it obviously can't be either 0 nor 100%. Secondly, some consider it reasonable to have the top marginal tax rate be in the range between 10% and 50%. 10% or 1/10 (one tenth) was often a historic norm in the past. Half or 100%, or 50/50 model is a common concept of fairness. Higher than 50% is counterproductive as most people would be discouraged to work when the state takes too much or their earnings (motivation and incentive matters), and also it becomes prohibitive on economic growth.  
In conclusion, up to 50% is considered by many conservative economists as Fair and socially optimal rate for balancing growth, equity, and incentives (marginal tax rates should [**not exceed 50%**](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1idyebs/cmv_income_marginal_tax_rates_should_never_exceed/){:target="_blank"}).  
&nbsp; More centar stance would be to have them in ranges between 20% and 40% or 42% as an answer to the Ultimate Question of Tax. Around 20% or 1/5 should cover 80% of people - in line with Pareto Principle 80/20 rule. Different countries, depending on culture and economic development, could have different limits, or Tiers so to say. For determining rates and tiers or band limits it should be looked into the public record of Statistics. It might take a few iterations to fine-tune them.  

&nbsp; Another issue with too high taxes is that people stop paying it and start actively working to avoid them - [**The Laffer Curve**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp){:target="_blank"} (optimal tax rate that maximizes state revenue). Some even think it could be as high as 70%, but that would be very unpopular and probably not socially acceptable, and also has some negative externalities with bad consequences.

![/laffer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisdj/borisdj.github.io/main/assets/images/tax-codex/laffer.jpg)

&nbsp; In general, the tax model should be [**Progressive**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp){:target="_blank"} ([how good is it](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/1g4vfd1/is_progressive_taxation_really_a_good_thing/){:target="_blank"}), with a higher rate for higher income, but still having a maximum limit to be widely acceptable (having precise Highest and Lowest Bracket).  
One could ask why such a model, a few reasons:  
-1. more philosophical argument with emphasis on humanity and solidarity (progress of civilisation),  
-2. for better social cohesion and more productive population (healthy, well educated and satisfied people are more fruitful),  
-3. Based on 'ability to pay' principle, meaning heaviest burden carried on the strongest shoulders (taxation equitable across income groups),  
-4. The marginal utulity of money drops off the higher it gets;
Reducing inequality also reduces social division and tensions (less group friction and conflict) with more economic mobility due to real and effective equality of opportunity (where each person is then responsible for the outcome). This would also lead to a happier population that could partially help with solving some of the pressing issues, like housing the crisis and low birth rates.  
&nbsp; In a political-economic sense this would be a standard capitalist system with a moderate level of social democracy - history shows that this is most stable in the long run, or the least bad we know so far. Somewhat similar to the Nordic model, mixture of a free market with less regulation, but with a strong welfare state, and labor market regulated by negotiations between labor unions and employer unions, where applicable. Another characteristic of this model is 'Flexicurity', relaxed hiring and firing regulations combined with strong social safety nets through government grants and social insurance.  
&nbsp; Still this model is not easily replicable in other countries, due to different culture and internal solidarity, but also a smaller population with higher economic development. Nevertheless one can be inspired by aspects of the nordic model and implement some elements to a certain level. One good example would be universal state-sponsored healthcare as market mechanisms might not lead to efficiency, since sick people and in distress can not evaluate the quality of medical services, nor easily compare different hospitals. If compared to the US where it is more expensive but less effective, because of a largely private, for-profit system with a complex insurance structure leading to higher administrative costs and drug prices ([denmark better healthcare less money](https://www.sciencenordic.com/culture-denmark-forskerzonen/how-does-denmark-have-better-healthcare-than-the-us-for-less-money/1451158){:target="_blank"}). Interesting hybrid model is the Swiss healthcare system as a decentralized, universal system funded by a combination of mandatory private health insurance from non-profit insurers, taxes, and out-of-pocket payments.

For estimating all potential effects, the Income Distribution has very useful [visual graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1jgfcfq/oc_us_idual_income_distribution_2024/){:target="_blank"}:

![/us-income-distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisdj/borisdj.github.io/main/assets/images/tax-codex/us-income-distribution.jpg)

**Tax types**: 1. Income, 2. Capital gains, 3. Corporate, 4. VAT, 5. Inheritance, 6. Wealth.  
Focus will be on ***Personal Income tax*** and ***Capital Gains tax*** as they are direct and most important. Individual Income from labour but also from Dividends - [US_Div](https://wise.com/us/blog/how-are-dividends-taxed){:target="_blank"}: Ordinary/Qualified, [UK_Div](https://taxscouts.com/investor-capital-gains-tax-returns/dividend-tax-rates/){:target="_blank"} has rates not quite the same as income rates. Take in mind that for dividens tax corporate tax was already paid with declared profit.  
&nbsp; All tax related things should be Simple as possible in line with the [KISS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20262/keep-it-simple-stupid-principle-kiss-principle){:target="_blank"} principle. Also there should be minimal difference between Income and Capital Tax, so that there is no distortion of one or the other segment. This in practice could mean that tax tiers in both categories should be similar, while Social and Pension and Medical insurance should have max limit on mandatory part, with anything above to be optional.  
&nbsp; On the technical side, tax rules should be simple, and percentages to be round numbers with only a few incremental steps like +- 2% or 5%. There should exist several standardized tiers, for societies with different stages of development, that also have specific culture and history. 

**(1) Income Tax** Brackets with simplified example - to better understand the concept:

Tax Models: (X-Extra); S - Small, M - Medium, L - Large (first 10 K tax free in all columns; M as golden mean)  
US yearly average $ value, so it should be scaled to each country and specific currency.
And, due to inflation, ranges From-To should be updated periodically, like every 5 years or so.

In the US bottom 20% of people earn up to around 24 000 $ / year, while top 20% earners are above 120 000 $ annually.  

For example, with gross income of 60 and 120 K, total Yearly Tax and Effective rate in model M:  
10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 + 30K * 0.2 + 10K * 0.25 _ _ _ _ _ _ = 10,000 (eff.rate 16%, US and UK have 12% & 19%)  
10K * 0 + 10K * 0.1 + 30K * 0.2 + 50K * 0.25 + 20K * 0.3 = 29,000 (eff.rate 24%, US and UK have 17% & 30%)

&nbsp; One rule of thumb, based on common sense, would be to have less developed countries start with models that have lower taxes, and then every decade to aim for a higher model until it comes to optimal range. Changes should be gradual, asymptotic alike movement, to have smooth transition. For example in [Denmark the top tier is 56%](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/denmark/idual/taxes-on-personal-income){:target="_blank"}, which is little above our median line, but it still seems to work fine in their society, as they remain country with high Happiness Score. So the remarkable thing is widespread acceptance of this very high burden and tax regime. Several other countries could be taken into consideration for comparative analysis including: Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, UAE, Singapore.  
&nbsp; Currently the [US](https://www.irs.gov/filing/federal-income-tax-rates-and-brackets){:target="_blank"} has federal income tax with top marginal rate at 37 %, while in the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates){:target="_blank"} it goes to 45%. Aa we can see both countries already have [progressive tax system](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/us-tax-system-progressive/){:target="_blank"} where most are [paying fair share](https://www.federalbudgetinpictures.com/do-the-rich-pay-their-fair-share/){:target="_blank"} when it comes Income tax, but Capital tax remains somewhat problematic. Tax expenditures (deductions, exemptions, and preferential tax rates) are major driver of inequality, due to bad [tax policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_policy_and_economic_inequality_in_the_United_States){:target="_blank"}. Changes post 1980s in the US regarding capital gains and dividends were the [largest contributor](https://equitablegrowth.org/new-research-finds-capital-gains-are-highly-concentrated-and-hardly-taxed-underscoring-widespread-u-s-inequality/){:target="_blank"} to the increase in the overall wealth inequality. ***Hyperfinancialization***, referring to the increased dominance and complexity of the financial sector in the economy, has been a significant trend over the past several decades, particularly since the 1980s. Many argue that such excessive Financialization of entire economy, with control of financial sector over everything else, is a major driver of rising income and wealth inequality.  

&nbsp; **(2) Capital gains** - in order to promote prudent long term investments and ventures, the top tier here could be somewhat lower then top income tiers, probably up to 30% as opposed to 40%, but this should be more analysed and requires further discussion. Currently in many jurisdictions long term (longer than 1 year) capital gains tax is mostly around 20% like the US, while for example in France and UK goes up to 30% and 32%.  
&nbsp; Relevant issue with gains tax is when a person never sold the shares and usually no dividend either, meaning no realised gains. Instead they just take large credits with stocks as collateral, so called 'stock-as-collateral [tax loophole](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1e0hq0g/eli5_how_does_the_take_loans_instead_of_selling/){:target="_blank"}', also named [**'buy-borrow-die'**](https://smartasset.com/investing/buy-borrow-die-how-the-rich-avoid-taxes){:target="_blank"} (YT: [BBD - The Free Money Loophole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS-bCMPgABo){:target="_blank"} and [Mother of all loopholes](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/03/tax-loophole-buy-borrow-die/682031/){:target="_blank"}) or ['buy-borrow-hold'](https://inequality.org/article/heard-about-buy-borrow-die-meet-buy-hold-for-decades-sell/){:target="_blank"} strategy ([BBD explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyBorrowDieExplained/comments/1f26rsf/buy_borrow_die_explained/){:target="_blank"}). Here the interest rate on loan is very low, more than market returns even, and significantly lower then tax rate. For such a situation, legislative consideration should be to have on realised gains when taking large credit that is secured by stocks and alike. Taxable event would be any time the asset is utilized to receive money from it's value ([**closing the borrowing loophole**](https://equitablegrowth.org/closing-the-billionaire-borrowing-loophole-would-strengthen-the-progressivity-of-the-u-s-tax-code/){:target="_blank"}). Of course it would only apply over a certain threshold and above any deduction. There were even suggestions to go straight to [taxing unrealized gains](https://inequality.org/article/capital-gains-taxes-inequality/){:target="_blank"}, but it is not a good nor fair solution and would not work properly so we will disregard it. Instead simply closing the previously mentioned borrowing loophole would be more than enough. Also one main property where a person or family (married couple single property but limit 3x) lives more then 2 years ought not have Capital gains tax (Private Residence Relief) up to some reasonable limit and size. In high inflation environments, it's crucial to differentiate between nominal gains (price increases) and real gains (purchasing power increases). Taxes on nominal gains, especially capital gains, can be unfair and distort investment decisions when they don't reflect true wealth increases. Adjusting tax calculations for inflation is important for fairness and economic efficiency. Reason more why we should get rid of inflation as much as possible.  

&nbsp; **(3) Corporate tax** could also have maybe 3 middle tiers to give support to smaller companies in order to promote healthy competition. Say 2% for small Solo Proprietorship (SP), 12% for smaller firms like statups for first 2 or 4 years if they have revenue bellow some treshold, and 22% for large companies. At the moment, US has corporate tax rate of 21%, while EU average is almost the same 21.5% but in ranges for 10% to 30%, depending on the specific country. Should not be too high because when using profits to pays out dividend or even doing shares buyback which drives the stock price up, a taxable event will occur again.

&nbsp; **(4) VAT** - Value Added Tax on sales (consumption tax) is also quite important. Most EU countries have it from 18% to 25%, the Swiss having it at around 9%, while the US does Not have any on federal level and instead has only Sales tax in some states at 7 or 8 %. Even the UAE, know for low taxes, has 5% VAT. US deficit (1.8T) could be cut in half with [new 10% Federal VAT](https://www.ft.com/content/5b8a032b-2f86-466e-a9bc-d410cb2fbfa4){:target="_blank"} that would bring about 1 trillion revenue. Remaining deficit could be resolved with 400 billion from increased capital gains, while remaining 400 could be solved with be spending cuts, 200 from military budget and 200 from others not constructive areas.  
&nbsp; In general, many consider the optimal level for VAT to be between 5% and 20%, either 10% (my preference) or 15%, maybe 12% as a middle ground. Having Differential rates, based on product category, is also beneficial, with a reduced rate of 5% for basic food, some medicaments and baby equipment, while 20% or 25% for luxury goods. Options could be: Op1_0/10/20; Op2_5/12/20; Op3_5/15/25 %. Exclusive items include special jewelry, expensive watches, high-end fashion, sports cars, but also spirit alcohol and tobacco with which there would be no need for additional excise tax and thus keeping it simple. Average would still be around 10 or 12 % but it would have progressive effect. In the future this revenue might even enable some modest version of **UBI** - Universal Basic Income. Especially with all the technological progress and automatization including robotics and AI. Another approcah would be Friedman's **NIT** - Negative Income Tax, to reduce complex social insurance schemes and unnecessary cost of bureaucracy.  
&nbsp; Combined Vat and Income tax should still in average by under 50% for most people. And to help solve housing issues first house or apartment should be Vat tax-free, and in addition to have subsidies credits for young couple for first home.  

&nbsp; **(5) Inheritance tax**, that in some countries is levied only above a certain threshold and within a reasonable range (say from 5 to 20 %). In some place they are called Death taxes or referred as Estate taxes.  
One example for inheritance is Switzerland where it is not on federal level but cantonal, and applies only above 1 million CHF, and goes from 1 to 7%. On the other hand, the [US](https://smartasset.com/taxes/all-about-the-estate-tax){:target="_blank"} (above 14 million) and [UK](https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax){:target="_blank"} (above 325 K) have a rate up to 40%. Personal stance here is that it would be appropriate to be 10% or 20% for values above 1 million $. When making a decision do note that not many countries have this type of tax, so it is not widely used.  
&nbsp; **(6) Wealth tax** is hard to enforce and could push people to move and migrate into other countries or states, and not worth it ([Super-rich leaving Norway](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly){:target="_blank"} or moving from California to Texas). Also, since it was previously accumulated, on which tax was already paid so there is no justification to tax it again every year, just like there is no excuse for taxing money savings with inflation every few months. Especially, since wealth or money will be used/spent in the future, at which point there it will again be probably taxed via VAT.

| 6  | **Wealth**        | None      |         - |         - |         - |             |

&nbsp; A [**SIMPLER tax code**](https://www.intuit.com/blog/innovative-thinking/taxpayer-empowerment/a-simpler-tax-code/){:target="_blank"} means simpler taxes for everyone (reduce **6000 pages** tax code to less then 100 by keeping only an effective set of deductions, with basic short edition in 10 pages - less chance for a bug aka hole).  
&nbsp; Emphasys should be on sustainability and stability, with balanced budget and long-term planning. That is why this would be considered as a **Protocol**, with standardized rules (an ***engineering approach*** to problem-solving).

![/tax-code-size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisdj/borisdj.github.io/main/assets/images/tax-codex/tax-code-size.jpg)

&nbsp; Still in the long term, all countries should aim towards more unified ranges, and human values should be universal. It could also make civilisation more stable, with less issues for tax avoidance using offshore heavens, or more precisely [secrecy jurisdiction](https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/06/14/do-tax-havens-still-matter/){:target="_blank"}. In the meantime more global coordination would be needed, and special inspection for [trust funds](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/family-and-care/death-and-bereavement/using-a-trust-to-cut-your-inheritance-tax){:target="_blank"} required. [**Trusts**](https://taxjustice.net/faq/how-do-trusts-work/){:target="_blank"} have high legal expenses (lawyer and paperworks) and practically are only available to persons with very high net worth, privilege of the rich or unfair advantage ([how trusts avoid taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstatePlanning/comments/1amij95/how_does_a_trust_avoid_taxes/){:target="_blank"}). For closing the loopholes it would be best to call experts in accounting, finance, and lawyers that have work on creating these scheme, and use their experince to fix it permanently. Also to have a reward if someone find a hole that could be exploited, similar how IT systems often has prize for white hat ethical hackers that discovers bug or security issue and help with patching it (tax holes bounty).  
&nbsp; One thing to have in mind, for future sake, is that if we ever reform the monetary systems to permanently low money inflation (like k-percent rule), then currrency itself would not rapidly lose value as today. In such environment monetary premium of non productive asset such as real estate would reduce greatly, hence capital gain taxes on those would not be significant, instead income from labour and direct capital like dividends, would be more important, as well as revenue from Vat. This would be good as it would make taxation less complicated and easier to implement.   

&nbsp; Tax marginal rate limits (e.g. min 10%, max 45%) should be set with **constitutional law** so that it needs a supermajority (2/3) of parliament for change - using existing legal framework. While in that range different models could be changed with simple majority but this should not become regular practices, only if not absolutely needed. Any change should be publicly discussed and debated, also planned in advance with any effects calculated into a model, so that everybody is prepared and knows what to expect ahead of time. Similar how Linux, open source operating system, has regular yearly version update in the same month, an ultimate predictability.  
&nbsp; Another interesting idea is to have this Law, but also other laws and regulation to be on [***Github***](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}, an excellent collaboration platform, that has great visibility, transparent procedure for update, and detailed history of changes - audit info and track record. This was tried in Washington DC with authoritative [**digital source laws**](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/){:target="_blank"}, sort of like The Legal Repository ([Git for policymaking](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/github-for-policy){:target="_blank"} and [Version control for law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmLpJEZyvI0){:target="_blank"}). Of course, a solicitor or legal professional could consult IT experts or tech-savvy individuals for advice with using such a tool.  
&nbsp; In this regard, laws themself could have conditional expiration, say 50 years (with exception to constitutional laws), after which they should be reviewed, and discarded if obsolete or renewed(confirmed) with optional amendments. This would help to keep regulation smaller and effective, and at the same time gives each generation a direct chance to express their stance and opinion about matters in question.

&nbsp; Lastly, government spending is important as well. The ideas, that are floating lately, how fiscal responsibility is absolutely irrelevant is total nonsense, [MMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_monetary_theory){:target="_blank"} included. Real economy, as well as resources and production, have natural limits and so does state budget. Also taxes need to be public and have broad support from citizens. Last few decades we all have witnessed ever growing deficits, with debt ballooning and money printing overuse. Even with all that, there are smaller investments in public infrastructure, and growing wealth gaps over the past few decades. This is due to lower taxes, and higher inflation that acts as a **regressive** tax because fiat currency has no constraints. Any credit should have such incentives to be used for new investment, and less on everyday expenditures (reduce the consumerism and its bad effects). This statement holds equally true for individuals, companies, and countries. Denmark again, even here, stand as a positive example with very little or no deficit accrual, so Danes live better with less, compared to US citizens. Switzerland is another role model, with decentralised but efficient goverment, that have historically maintained a low deficit,  They have "[debt brake](https://www.efd.admin.ch/en/the-debt-brake){:target="_blank"}", a constitutional rule that limits government spending to the expected revenue over the course of a normal economic cycle. This rule helps to ensure fiscal stability and prevent excessive debt accumulation. Overall at least around 10% od budget should be allocated for development and investment including new infrastructure projects, so not all should go into basic consumption.  

&nbsp; As always, one should approach the issues with cautious, as public companies over a long time are prone to corruption. So either to have multiple strong checks and balances that are independent and separated with mechanisms to ensure they stay as such. Or to have more private sector and contractors, while keeping transparency in public procurement and fair tenders, equal for all participants. Finding and maintaining a delicate balance, as optimal equilibrium, in such dynamics requires dedication and constant work. Otherwise, it can easily turn into populism in political domain and crony capitalism on economic side. If there is too much corruption, and if money from the budget is wasted on unproductive things or misallocated, then people would not see the point in paying their "fair share" to society, and lose **trust** in institutions. Also too much expenditure on the military is not seen as great utility. While if the system is efficient, where for example all children have good schools, then not many would oppose a slighter higher taxes, though not too high, and most would willingly pay it, a sensible thing to do. They would know it has a good purpose with noble cause, and will benefit them as well.  

&nbsp; Finally, how could these changes be made. Learn as much about the problem and about potential solution. Everybody can write to their Elected Representatives asking them to incorporate this agenda as active issue that should be worked on. Then in future election vote for the party or more specifically for individuals that aligns the most with these models and supports them. It won't be easy and could take a longer time, but one should start now and think about future generations. In the end, majority can vote out what is in their best interest, but also must take care of interest entire population and to keep the economic wheel working smoothly. The broared consensus is made for elected model, the better.
