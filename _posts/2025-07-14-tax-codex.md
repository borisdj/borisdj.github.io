&nbsp; Taxes are mostly boring and usually [disliked](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/common-sense-science/202504/we-hate-paying-taxes){:target="_blank"} (especially by [Americans](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/){:target="_blank"}), but still are very important and relevant, both for single person and for the broader community. One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be educated about it and have an informed opinion.  
&nbsp; Next to mention that taxes enable society to function at large, to manage shared resources and cover for the costs. Some things can not be built and used individually, it is not practical nor efficient, because of scale and logistics. This includes public infrastructure, such as roads and city instalations for water and electricity, and in some cases also Hospitals and Schools assuming there are public ones.  
&nbsp; Civil society organizes itself as a country of citizens or a nation state. Always remember that the function of all Government Services is to **serve** the people and community, and never forget that politicians are your employees (servants) and not masters.

&nbsp; Next important issue is the level of taxes and their complexity, several types, as well as how they are implemented and controlled/enforced. Firstly, it obviously can't be neither 0 nor 100%. Secondly, some consider it reasonable to have top marginal tax rate be in the range between 10% and 50%. 10% or 1/10 (one tenth) was often a historic norm in the past. Half or 100%, or 50/50 model is a common concept of fairness. Higher than 50% is counterproductive as most people would be discouraged to work when the state takes too much or their earnings (motivation and incentive matters), and also it becomes prohibitive on economic growth.  
In conclusion, up to 50% is considered by many conservative economists as Fair and socially optimal rate for balancing growth, equity, and incentives (marginal tax rate should [**not exceed 50%**](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1idyebs/cmv_income_marginal_tax_rates_should_never_exceed/){:target="_blank"}).  
&nbsp; Another issue with too high taxes is that people stop paying it and start actively working to avoid them - [**The Laffer Curve**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp){:target="_blank"} (optimal tax rate that maximizes state revenue). Some even consider that it could be as high as 70%, but that would not be socially acceptable and has some negative externalities and bad consequences.  
More centar stance would be to have them in ranges between 20 and 40% (around 20% or 1/5 should cover 80% of people - in line with Pareto Principle 80/20 rule).  
Different countries, depending on culture and economic development, could have different limits, or Tiers so to say.

&nbsp; In general, the tax model should be [**Progressive**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp){:target="_blank"} ([how good is it](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/1g4vfd1/is_progressive_taxation_really_a_good_thing/){:target="_blank"}), with a higher rate for higher income, but still having a maximum limit to be widely acceptable (having precise Highest and Lowest Bracket).  
One could ask why such a model, 2 reasons:  
-first is a more philosophical argument with emphasis on humanity and solidarity (progress of civilisation),  
-second is for better social cohesion including a more productive population (healthy, well educated and satisfied people are more fruitful).  
Reducing inequality also reduces social division and friction with more economic mobility due to real and effective equality of opportunity. This would also lead to a happier population that could partially help with solving some of the pressing issues, like housing the crisis and low birth rates.  
&nbsp; In a political-economic sense this would be a standard capitalist system with a moderate level of social democracy - history shows that this is most stable in the long run, or the least bad that we know of so far. Somewhat similar to the Nordic model, combination of a free market with less regulation, but with a strong welfare state, and labor market regulated by negotiations between labor unions and employer unions, where applicable. Another characteristic is 'Flexicurity', relaxed hiring and firing regulations combined with strong social safety nets through government grants and social insurance.  
Still this model is not easily replicable in other countries, due to different culture and internal solidarity, but also a smaller population with higher economic development. Nevertheless one can be inspired by aspects of the nordic model and implement some elements to a certain level. One good example would be state-sponsored healthcare as market mechanisms might not lead to efficiency, since sick people and in distress can not evaluate the quality of medical services, nor easily compare different hospitals.

&nbsp; Tax types: corporate, individual on income and capital gains, VAT, Wealth. Focus will be on Income tax (the ordinary from labour but also from dividends) and Gains tax as they are most direct and relevant.  
&nbsp; To keep things Simple as possible ([KISS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20262/keep-it-simple-stupid-principle-kiss-principle){:target="_blank"} principle) there should be minimal difference between Income and Capital Tax, so that there is no distortion of one or the other segment. This in practice could mean that tax tiers in both categories should be similar, while Social and Pension and Medical insurance should have max limit on mandatory part, with anything above to be optional. Still, in order to promote prudent long term investments and ventures, the top tier of capital gains and dividends could be somewhat lower then top income tier, maybe 30% as opposed to 40%, but this should be more analysed and requires further discussion (currently in many jurisdictions it is mostly around 20%).
Relevant issue with capital tax is when a person never sold the shares nor received any dividend, meaning no realised gains. Instead just taking large credits with stocks as collateral, so called 'stock-as-collateral [tax loophole](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1e0hq0g/eli5_how_does_the_take_loans_instead_of_selling/){:target="_blank"}' but also named [**'buy-borrow-die'**](https://smartasset.com/investing/buy-borrow-die-how-the-rich-avoid-taxes){:target="_blank"} (YT: [BBD - The Free Money Loophole(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS-bCMPgABo){:target="_blank"}) or ['buy-borrow-hold'](https://inequality.org/article/heard-about-buy-borrow-die-meet-buy-hold-for-decades-sell/){:target="_blank"} strategy. Here the interest rate on loan is very low, more than market returns even, and significantly lower then tax rate. For such a situation, legislative consideration should be to have on realised gains when taking large credit that is secured by stocks. Taxable event would be any time the asset is utilized to receive money from it's value ([**closing the borrowing loophole**](https://equitablegrowth.org/closing-the-billionaire-borrowing-loophole-would-strengthen-the-progressivity-of-the-u-s-tax-code/){:target="_blank"}). Of course it would only apply over a certain threshold and above any deduction.
Several other countries could be taken into consideration for comparative analysis including: Germany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, UAE, Singapore.  
One rule of thumb, based on common sense, would be to have less developed countries start with models that have lower taxes, and then every decade to aim for a higher model until it comes to optimal range. Changes should be gradual, asymptotic alike movement. For example in [Denmark the top tier is 56%](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/denmark/individual/taxes-on-personal-income){:target="_blank"}, which is little above our median line, but it still works fine in their society.  
&nbsp; Corporate tax could also have maybe 3 middle tiers to give support to smaller companies in order to promote healthy competition. Say 2% for small Solo Proprietorship (SP), 12% for smaller firms up to some limmit based either on profit or revenue, and 22% for large companies. Currently, US has corporate tax rate of 21%, while EU average in almost the same 21.5% but in ranges for 10% to 30%.

&nbsp; VAT - Value Added Tax on sale is also somewhat important. Most EU countries have it from 18% to 25%, the Swiss having it at around 9%, while the US does not have and instead has only Sales tax in some states at 7 or 8 %. In general, many consider the optimal level for VAT to be between 5% and 20%, so 10% (my preference) or 12% as a middle ground. Having Differential rates is also beneficial, with a reduced rate of 5% for basic food, some medicaments and baby equipment, while 20% or 25% for luxury goods. Exclusive items include special jewelry, expensive watches, high-end fashion, sports cars, but also spirit alcohol and tobacco with which there would be no need for additional excise tax and thus keeping it simple. In the future this revenue might even enable the same modest version of UBI - Universal basic income, to reduce complex social insurance schemes.  
&nbsp; Tax on wealth tax is hard to enforce and could force people to leave and migrate into other countries or states, and not worth it ([Super-rich leaving Norway](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly){:target="_blank"} or moving from California to Texas). Also since it is prior accumulated, tax is already paid so there is no justification to tax it again every year, just like there is no excuse for taxing money savings with inflation every few months. Especially, since wealth or money will be used/spent in the future, at which point there it will again be probably taxed via VAT. With lower inflation, there would be less asset price appreciation.  
&nbsp; Inheritance tax, that in some countries is levied only above a certain threshold and within a reasonable range (say from 5 to 20 %). In some place they are called Death taxes or referred as Estate taxes.  
One example for inheritance is Switzerland where it is not on federal level but cantonal, and applies only above 1 million CHF, and goes from 1 to 7%. On the other hand, the [US](https://www.irs.gov/filing/federal-income-tax-rates-and-brackets){:target="_blank"} and [UK](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates){:target="_blank"} have a top rate of up to 37% and 45%, respectively. Personal stance here is that it would be acceptable to be 10% or 15% for values above 1 million $.

Simplified Income **Tax Brackets** example - to better understand the concept
(US yearly average $ value, should be scaled to each country and specific currency):  

| №  | From    | To Amount | Step  | Model S | Model M | Model L |
| -  | ------: |----------:| ----: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| 1  |       0 |    20 000 |  20 K |  0 %    |  5 %    |  5 %    |
| 2  |  20 001 |    50 000 |  30 K | 10 %    | 15 %    | 15 %    |
| 3  |  50 001 |   100 000 |  50 K | 20 %    | 25 %    | 25 %    |
| 4  | 100 001 |   500 000 | 400 K | 25 %    | 30 %    | 35 %    |
| 5  | 500 001 |  no limit | -     | 30 %    | 40 %    | 45 %    |

Tax Models : S - Smaller; M - Medium; L - Larger

For example, with gross income of 130 K, total Yearly Tax in model M would be:  
20,000 * 0    
30,000 * 0.15 +  
50,000 * 0.25 +  
30,000 * 0.3 = 26,000 (effective rate 20%)

&nbsp; Emphasys should be on sustainability and stability, with balanced budget and long-term planning. That is why this would be considered as a **Protocol**, with standardized rules (an engineering approach to problem-solving).
On the technical side, tax rules should be se, and percentages to be round numbers with only a few incremental steps like +- 2% or 5%. There should exist several standardized tiers, for societies with different stages of development, that also have specific culture and history.  
Still in the long term, all countries should aim towards more unified ranges, and human values should be universal. It could also make civilisation more it stable, with less issues for tax avoidance using offshore heavens. In the meantime more global coordination would be needed, and special inspection into [trust funds](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/family-and-care/death-and-bereavement/using-a-trust-to-cut-your-inheritance-tax){:target="_blank"}. [**Trusts**](https://taxjustice.net/faq/how-do-trusts-work/){:target="_blank"} have high legal costs (lawyer and paperworks) and practically are only available to persons with very high net worth, privilege of the rich or unfair advantage ([trust avoid taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstatePlanning/comments/1amij95/how_does_a_trust_avoid_taxes/){:target="_blank"}).

&nbsp; Tax marginal rate limits (e.g. min 10%, max 45%) should be set with **constitutional law** so that it needs a supermajority (2/3) of parliament for change. While in that range different models could be changed with se majority but this should not become regular practices, only if not absolutely needed. Any change should be publicly discussed and debated, also planned in advance with any effects calculated into a model, so that everybody is prepared and knows what to expect ahead of time.  
&nbsp; Another interesting idea is to have this Law, but also other laws and regulation to be on ***Github*** repository that has excellent visibility, transparent procedure for update, and detailed history of changes - audit info and track record. This was tried in Washington DC with authoritative [**digital source laws**](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/){:target="_blank"}.  
In this regard, laws themself could have conditional expiration, say 50 years (with exception to constitutional laws), after which they should be reviewed, and discarded if obsolete or renewed(confirmed) with optional amendments. This would help to keep regulation smaller and effective, and at the same time gives each generation a direct chance to express their stance and opinion about matters in question.

&nbsp; Lastly, government spending is important as well. The idea that fiscal responsibility is absolutely irrelevant is total nonsense. Real economy, as well as resources and production, natural limits. Also taxes need to be public and broad support for citizens. Last few decades we all have witnessed ever growing deficits, with debt ballooning and money printing overuse. Even with all that, there are smaller investments in public infrastructure, and growing wealth gaps over the past few decades (due to lower taxes, and higher inflation that acts as a regressive tax).  
Any credit should only be used for new investment, and not everyday expenditures. This statement holds equally true for individuals, companies, and countries.
&nbsp; In addition, when there is too much corruption, and if money from the budget is wasted on unproductive things, or allocated unproductively, then people would not see the point in paying their "fair share" to society. Also too much expenditure on the military is not seen as great utility. While if the system is efficient, with all children having good schools then not many would oppose a slighter higher taxes, and most would willingly pay it, as they know it has a good purpose with noble cause, and will benefit them as well.  
&nbsp; Still one should stay cautious, as public companies over a long time are prone to corruption. So either to have multiple strong checks and balances that are independent and separated with mechanisms to ensure they stay as such. Or to have more private sector and contractors, while keeping transparency in public procurement and fair tenders, equal for all participants. Finding and maintaining a delicate balance in such dynamics requires dedication and constant work.
