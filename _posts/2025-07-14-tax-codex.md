&nbsp; Taxes are mostly boring and usuwealthally [disliked](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/common-sense-science/202504/we-hate-paying-taxes){:target="_blank"} (especially by [Americans](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/){:target="_blank"}), but still are very important and relevant, both for single person and for broader community. One can not avoid them, not easily at least, so you should be educated about it and have an informed opinion.  
Next to mention that taxes enable society to function on a large, to manage shared resources and cover for the costs. Some things can not be built and used individually, it is not practical nor efficient, because of scale and logistics. This includes public infrastructure, such as roads, and in some cases also Hospitals and Schools assuming there are public ones.  
&nbsp; Civil society organizes itself as a country of citizens or a nation state. Always remember that function of all Government Services is to **Serve** the people and community, and never forget that politicians are your servants (employees) and not master.

&nbsp; Next important issue is the level of taxes, different kinds and types, and their complexity but how they are implemented and controlled/enforced. Firstly, obviously it can't be 0 nor 100%. Secondly, some consider it reasonable to be in the range from 10% up to 50% top marginal tax rate.  
10% or 1/10 (one tenth) was often a historic norm in the past. Half or 100%, or 50/50 model is a common concept of fairness. Higher than 50% is counterproductive as most people would be discouraged to work when the state takes too much or their earnings (motivation and incentive matters), and also it becomes prohibitive on economic growth. In conclusion, up to 50% is considered by many conservative economists as Fair and socially optimal rate for balancing growth, equity, and incentives (marginal tax rate should [**not exceed 50%**](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1idyebs/cmv_income_marginal_tax_rates_should_never_exceed/){:target="_blank"}).  
&nbsp; Another issue with too high taxes is that people stop paying it and start actively working to avoid them - [**The Laffer Curve**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp){:target="_blank"} (optimal tax rate that maximizes government revenue). Some even consider that it could be high as 70%, but that would not be socially acceptable and has some negative consequences.  
More centar stance would be to have them in ranges between 20 and 40% (20% or 1/5 should cover 80% of people).   
Different countries, depending on culture and economic development, could have different limits, or Tiers so to say.

&nbsp; In general, the tax model should be [**Progressive**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp){:target="_blank"} ([how good is it](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/1g4vfd1/is_progressive_taxation_really_a_good_thing/){:target="_blank"}), with a higher rate for higher income, but still having maximum limit to be widely acceptable (having precise Highest and Lowest Bracket).  
One could ask why such a model, 2 reasons: first is a more philosophical argument with emphasis on humanity and solidarity (progress of civilisation), and second is for better social cohesion including a more productive population (healthy, well educated and satisfied people are more fruitful). Reducing inequality also reduces social division and friction with more economic mobility due to real and effective equality of opportunity.  This would also lead to more happier population, that could partially help with solving some of pressing issues, like housing crisis and low birth rates.  
&nbsp; In a political-economic sense this would be a standard capitalist system with a moderate level of social democracy - history shows that this is most stable in the long run. Somewhat similar to Nordic model, combination of a free market with less regulation, and a strong welfare state, with labor market regulated by negations between labor and employer unions.  
Another characteristic is 'Flexicurity', relaxed hiring and firing regulations combined with strong social safety nets through government grants and social insurance.  
Still this model is not easily replicable in other countries, due to different culture and internal solidarity, but also smaller population with higher economic development. Nevertheless one can inspired by aspects of the nordic model and implement some elements to certain level. One good example would be state-sponsored healthcare as market mechanism might not lead to efficiency, since sick person and in distres can not evaluate the quality of medical services, nor easily compare different hospitals.

&nbsp; Tax types: corporate, individual on income and capital gains, VAT, Wealth. Focus will be on Income (both from labour but also dividends as ordinary income) and Gains tax as they are most direct and relevant.  
&nbsp; To keep things Simple as possible ([KISS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20262/keep-it-simple-stupid-principle-kiss-principle){:target="_blank"} principle) ther should be minimal difference between Income and Capital Tax, so that there is not distortion of one or the another segment. This in practice could mean that tax tiers in both categories should be simmilar if not the same, while Social and Pension and Medical insurance should have max limit on mandatory part, with anything above to be optional.
Relevant issue with capital tax is to close one loophole often used today, and that is never selling shares, meaning no realised gains, not taking divident, instead taking large credits with stocks as collateral. For such situation, it might be considered realised gain when taking large credit over some threshold that is secured by stocks.
Several other countiers could be taken into consideration for comparative analysis including: Geramany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, UAE, Singapore.  
One rule of thumb, based on common sense, would be to have less developed countries start with models that have lower taxes, and then every decade to aim for a higher model until it comes to optimal range. Changes should be gradual, asymptotic alike movement.

&nbsp; VAT - Value Added Tax on sale is also somewhat important. Most EU countries have it from 18% to 25%, Swiss having it at around 9%, while the US does not have and instead has only Sales tax in some states at 7 or 8 %. In general, many consider optimal level for VAT to be between 5% and 20%, so 10% (my preference) or 12% as a middle ground. Having Differential rates is also beneficial, with reduced rate of 5% for basic food, some medicaments and baby equipment, while 20% or 25% for luxury goods. Lux items include special jewelry, expensive watches, high-end fashion, sports cars, but also spirit alcohol and tobacco with which there would be no need for additional excise tax and thus keeping it simple.
&nbsp; Tax on wealth tax is hard to enforce and could force people to leave and migrate into other countries or states, so not worth it ([Super-rich leave Norway](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly){:target="_blank"} or moving from California to Texas). Also since it is prior accumulated, tax is already paid so there is no justification to tax it again every year, just like there is no excuse for taxing money savings with inflation every few months. Especially, since wealth or money will be used/spent in the future, at which point there it will again be probably taxed via VAT. With lower inflation, there would be less asset price appreciation.
&nbsp; Inheritance tax, that in some countries is levied only above a certain threshold and within a reasonable range (say from 5 to 20 %).
One example is Switzerland where it is not on federal level but cantonal, and applies only above 1 million CHF, and goes from 1 to 7%. On the other hand, the US and UK have a top rate of up to 40%. Personal stance here is that is would be acceptable to be 10% or 15% for value above 1 million $.

Simplified Income **Tax Brackets** example
(US yearly average $ value, should be scaled to each country and specific currency):  

| â„–  | To Amount | Step  | Model S | Model M | Model L |
| -  | --------: | ----: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| 1  |    20 000 |  20 K |  0 %    |  5 %    |  5 %    |
| 2  |    50 000 |  30 K | 10 %    | 15 %    | 15 %    |
| 3  |   100 000 |  50 K | 20 %    | 25 %    | 25 %    |
| 4  |   500 000 | 400 K | 25 %    | 30 %    | 35 %    |
| 5  |     Above |     - | 30 %    | 40 %    | 45 %    |

Tax Models : S - Smaller; M - Medium; L - Larger

For example, with gross income of 130 K, total Yearly Tax in model M would be:  
20,000 * 0    
30,000 * 0.15 +  
50,000 * 0.25 +  
30,000 * 0.3 = 26,000 (effective rate 20%)  

&nbsp; Emphasys should be on sustainability and stability, with balanced budget and long-term planning. That is whay this would be consider as a **Protocol**.
On the technical side, tax rules should be simple, and percentages round numbers with only few incremental steps like +- 2% or 5%. There should exist several standardized tiers, for societies with different stages of development, that also have specific culture and history.  
Still in the long term, all countries should aim towards more unified ranges, and humans values should be universal, and it would make stable, also with lees issues for tax avaidance using offshore heavens. In the meantime more global coordination would be needed, and special inspection into trust funds. Trusts have high legal costs and practically are only available to persons with very high net worth.

&nbsp; Tax marginal rate limits (e.g. min 15%, max 45%) should be set with constitutional law so that it needs a supermajority (2/3) of parliament for change. While in that range different models could be changed with simple majority but this should not become regular practices, only if not absolutely needed. Any change should be publicly discussed and debated, also planned in advance with any effects calculated into a model.  
&nbsp; Another interesting idea is to have this Law, but also other laws and regulation to be on Github repository that has excellent visibility, transparent procedure for update, and detailed history of changes - audit info and track record. This was tried in Washington DC with authoritative [digital source laws](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/){:target="_blank"}).  
In this regard, laws themself could have conditional expiration, say 50 years (with exception to consitutional laws), after which they should be reviewed, and discarded if obsolete or renewed(confirmed) with optional amendments. This would help to keep regulation smaller and effective, and at the same time gives each generation a direct chance to express their stance and opinion about matters in question.

&nbsp; Lastly, government spending is important as well. The idea that fiscal responsibility is absolutely irrelevant is total nonsense. Real economy, as well as resources and production, natural limits. Also taxes need to be public and broad support for citizens. Last few decades we all have witnessed ever growing deficits, with debt ballooning and money printing overuse, and even with all still having smaller investment in public infrastructure, and growing wealth gaps (due to lower taxes, and higher inflation that acts as a regressive tax).  
&nbsp; In addition, when there is too much corruption, and if money from the budget is wasted on unproductive things, or allocated unproductively, then people would not see the point in paying their fair share to society. Also too much expenditure on military is not seen as great utility. While if the system is efficient, with all children have good schools then people would not oppose a slighter higher taxes, and most would willingly pay it, as they know it has a good purpose with noble cause.  
&nbsp; Still one should stay cautious, as public companies over a long time are prone to corruption. So either to have multiple strong checks and balances, and/or have more private sector and contractors, while keeping transparency in public procurement and fair tenders, equal for all participants. Finding and maintaining a delicate balance in such dynamics required dedication and constant work.
