## Introduction [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #introduction }
-- The following text (small eBook) will discuss money systems of the past, existing ones in present, but also future perspective and possibilities. In a futuristic context, the first word to mention is [**Bitcoin**](https://bitcoin.org/en/){:target="_blank"}, or short **BTC (₿)**. To explain it, there is a phrase saying: *"It's an Answer, and let's see now what the Question is"*. For better understanding we need first to grasp the history of money and current monetary systems.<br>
-- Discussion is lengthy as is the nature of topic, so it's divided into segments for easier understanding.
Do not be discouraged if material seems foreign. Most people depending on level of familiarity with the subject will need to read it several times, since it is abundant with different information. Also best to spread it across multiple days, sleep over it, after which many questions will pop up. For those you have friends and forums to talk/chat with, as well as blogs, articles to read and YT channels / podcasts for listening. And the more you know the more you want to find out, so-called *'Down the Rabbit Hole'*. What is important to get is the idea and fundamentals, and how to approach it. Not everybody needs to know all technical details in order to use it. But for those how want to know it deeply some estimate is that minimum 100 hours of active learning is needed to dive into this thing. One comedian even said:<br>
*"It's everything you don't understand about money combined with everything you don't understand about computers".*<br>
But at the same time as you start to learn it, subsequently you will gain knowledge about economics, computer science, math, philosophy, political science, history, and even physics.<br>
PS
Work is still in progress and needs some final touch refactoring, don't mind eventual mistakes.


## 1. Beginning of trade and money [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #beginning-of-trade-and-money }
-- When people switched from hunter-gatherers to agriculture and farming around 10 000 years ago, it led to specialization in work, higher productivity and accumulation of surplus products. This enabled creation of bigger settlements, cities and eventually states. It also meant people could exchange (barter) excess things they got or made, for example grains or animals but it was not easy to determine the value of each item nor to split it. Also bigger groups of people meant you need to trade with stranges and some base for trust was needed ([Dunbar's number](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships) of 150 in close comunity). They needed a system which would made trade easier. That's why money was invented and how it came into being.<br>
-- In early days different things were used like special looking seashells, rare stones, etc. Interesting story is about [African trade glass beads](https://www.africanodyssey.co.uk/blog/a-brief-history-of-glass-beads-in-africa) ([hyper-inflation misuse for slave trade](https://www.afrikapital.org/p/akori-beads-hyper-inflation-and-ancient)) and another about large stones of [Yap people](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180502-the-tiny-island-with-human-sized-money). Later came metals and metal coins, from bronze, silver or gold. If one is wondering why these materials were chosen it's best first to define features of money ([The money Project](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/)) since it is an abstract concept:

| № | FUNCTION           | Description                                       |
| - | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Medium of Exchange | accepted method of payment for goods and services |
| 2 | Unit of Account    | measure of value                                  |
| 3 | Store of Value     | to hold value for long period of time             |
{: .table-style}

Examples of Function:<br>
1-Society uses certain item like pearl to trade for other goods<br>
2-Housing prices in Japan can be compared using Jen as a unit of account<br>
3-An ounce of gold could buy toga in Roman times, yet it can still buy a nice suit today<br>

| № | PROPERTIES    | Description                                                      |

| 1 | Durable       | able to withstand repeated use                                   |
| 2 | Divisible     | can divide to smaller units                                      |
| 3 | Portable      | easily carried and transported                                   |
| 4 | Acceptable    | universally recognizable                                         |
| 5 | Limited supply| being rare (scarcity) keeps stable value                         |
| 6 | Uniform       | units capable of mutual substitution, interchangeable (fungible) |

**Money** is language, a linguistic and social construct, and means of communicating value to each other. It is also collective and somewhat fictional story about value, with consent of majority. So it is not inherently valuable, we (subjectively) decide to give it merit. Human labour is still usually measured by working hours, so Money is also [Time, the most valuable currency](https://drtownsend.com/time-valuable-currency/) (one second lost cannot be bought back).

-- Obviously **Gold** had qualities to fulfill most of these roles, but it was not perfect, only best at that time, or so to say the least bad. Some of the disadvantages were not so easy to carry meaning expensive transport - low Portability, hard to Divide (need to melt), and also danger of theft and robbery.<br>
-- Because of that some merchants, later private banks and then central banks started holding gold for people and gave them **certificates** of how much gold they have. People then used those certificates for trade and that's how **paper money** also called **banknotes** (promissory notes - [IOU](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp) acronym of  *'I owe you'*) or colloquially **cash** came in existence. But bad side was introduction of intermediaries one needs to trust. And history is full of examples were that trust was exploited for all kind of reasons, usually by creating more notes than there was gold to back it. It led to bankruptcy of private banks or hyperinflation by central banks, both resulted in the same outcome, people losing their savings and purchase power.<br>
One of first central banks was [Bank of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Amsterdam) (*'Amsterdamsche Wisselbank'*) that was established back in 1609.<br>
-- Eventually when most countries seized full monetary control and further development of money came to a halt.<br>

## 2. Recent Historic periods [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #recent-historic-periods }
-- Until 19 century Silver coins were mostly utilized for local Currency, while Gold was used only for high value or international transactions. Definition of **Currency**: Measure in a specific time and place, medium of exchange and legal tender (must be accepted for deferred payment of debt) with strong network effect. Around 1870 switch to Gold was made because silver became abundant, and when it's not Rare it can not be good money. That's how the so-called ***'Gold Standard'*** was created in which paper notes were backed by physical gold. That was one of most stable and [prosperous periods](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2013/01/03/the-1870-1914-gold-standard-the-most-perfect-one-ever-created/?sh=1d83ebc64a6a).<br>
-- It was temporarily suspended during WW1 when countries, to fund the war efforts, needed to print more money then allowed. Also, there were exceptions from it during the Great Depression. Here to remark that the USA (United States of America) in [1933 seized all gold](https://theconversation.com/how-the-us-government-seized-all-citizens-gold-in-1930s-138467) bullion and coins from its citizens and forced them to sell it below market price.
Again, during WW2 money was overprinted and Gold Standard dropped. Then after WW2, actually in 1944 there was the [Bretton Woods Agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp) where 44 allied countries agreed to use **US Dollar (USD - $)** as world's Reserve Currency and for international trading and settlement. Reason it was the US dollar is that the USA was the dominant power at the time, both economically and militarily, which meant it had the greatest influence on the world. It also had biggest reserve of gold, of their own and of allied countries that was shipped there during WW2 for safekeeping.<br>
-- Later the US made a huge budget deficit, caused by excessive domestic spending and by Vietnam war, so the easiest solution was to print more money than there was gold to back it. That finally led to 1971 when the US government with Richard Nixon as president decided to [abandon the Gold Standard](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/15/rise-of-cryptocurrencies-can-be-traced-to-nixon-abandoning-gold-in-1971), meaning dollars were not redeemable for gold from US reserves. After that in 1975 the USA made deal with mayor **Oil** producing countries, [Saudi Arabia deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret) in the first place, that they sell primary energy commodity in US dollars. In return US will give them military protection and also make sure sea routes are safe for tankers, with the help of navy. That's how term **Petrodollars** came, an unofficial system or simply a global practice where dollars were desirable since one could exchange it easily for much needed barrels of petroleum. Some would say dollars were backed by crude oil, most important resource of 20th century. Using this system USA was exporting inflation to the rest of the world while importing real goods.<br>

### Modern age [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #modern-age }
-- In the modern age money has become more digital, essentially just numbers in computers of private and central banks, as well as in **World bank** and **IMF** (*International Monetary Fund*). First thing is that <ins>today money is created as **Debt**</ins> (*[Credit theory of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_theory_of_money) - Credit creation*). Essentially whenever someone gets a loan from the bank for a car or house or whatever, the bank just types that amount into a computer and new money is created while the entire money supply increases. Still when the debt is repaid that money gets destroyed or in the sense deleted.<br>
-- So in theory this could be stable, in a way that the economic output of a country is mapped to credit demand while Money Supply gets balanced the right way. However, in practice it is never like this, instead artificial push of loans, money markets, government agendas make it unstable and prone to corruption and crises with only solution always to inflate/increase the money supply. Temptation to use money printer is just irresistible.<br>
-- Even in [Roman times](https://www.worldhistory.org/Roman_Coinage/) gold and silver coins were, on demand from emperors, occasionally debased by melting them and leaving smaller quantity of precious metal. Eventually when coins became totally worthless the empire toppled. Also Coins were sometimes cut and scratched by thieves. To prevent [clipping](https://historyhouse.co.uk/articles/coin_clipping.html) modern coins usually have Reeded edges (grooved lines encircles perimeter), a counter-counterfeiting practice devised by Isaac Newton who was at a time Warden of the Royal Mint.<br>
**Examples of Crises:**
- The Recent event that triggered an overprint was the <ins>Economic Crisis of 2008</ins> which was partly created by banks who gave too much risky credits for real estate backed only by mortgages. And when it all collapsed the government just printed more money to cover it. Excuse was that letting all those banks fail would collapse entire economy both the US and the rest of the world. But still all people paid for the bank misbehavior while managers of those banks at the same time got huge bonuses.<br>
-There are some interesting movies about this subject and link with Wall Street such as: [The Big Short](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/) and [Margin Call](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615147/). It explains Derivatives like **[CDO](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/collateralized-debt-obligation-cdo/)** (*Collateralized Debt Obligation*) and [Synthetic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syntheticcdo.asp) ones, complex structured finance product, with bonds of subprime mortgage (risky home loans to individuals with poor or no credit history) that were used for betting.
- Another even bigger example was <ins>Corona pandemic</ins> during 2020/2021 that resulted in printing new additional [40% of all the money](https://techstartups.com/2021/05/22/40-us-dollars-existence-printed-last-12-months-america-repeating-mistake-1921-weimar-germany/) in existance.

-- Almost all money today is [FIAT](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fiat-money), declared by a government decree and not supported by physical commodity. It is determined by authority, made to be legal-tender (taxes as type of debt are payed with it), and imposed by force (Political -> Policy -> Police). Based on **Trust** that is often betrayed and backed only by promise it is sometimes referred as Fiat Fraud. Fiat is artificial "checkbook" money that also constraints real production ([Joyless economy](https://underconsumed.medium.com/the-joyless-economy-1976-tibor-scitovsky-17da683764ee)).<br>
-- Some consider Money printing ([*'fiat mining'*](https://bitcoinfoqus.com/fiat-mining/)) to be [**UBI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income) (*Universal Basic Income*) for the rich. Since new money is usually first available for people close to those in power ([Cantillon effect](https://whatismoney.info/cantillon-effect-bitcoin/)) and to ones that already have it as they can take big credits and own assets other than cash that is more inflation proof.<br>
-- The way a country can get more money for budget spending is that the Treasury issues Bonds and the **Central Bank** (*CB*), in the US case the [**FED**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/structure-federal-reserve-system.htm) (*Federal Reserve System* - [history](https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/about-the-fed/history/)), prints that amount of money and buys those bonds. Since today most money is not in the form of paper cash but is digital, creating new money is simply typing digits on the computers of banks that are saved to a database.<br>
-- Also monetary tools nad systems are made very complex. Some would argue deliberately in order to obfuscate it and make it less transparent and more obscure so that less people would object to the system itself. One of the printing mechanisms is [**QE-Quantitative Easing**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/quantitative-easing-qe/), where banks have the right to issue credits, meaning to print money as already explained, based on deposits they have, in ratio 1:10 or even more ([Fractional Reserve Banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp)). Opposite policy is known as **Quantitative Tightening**.<br>
-- So it is not just central bank that print money but also commercial ones all around the world. Let's now introduce the notion of **[Eurodollar](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurodollar.asp)** - Dollar deposits at foreign banks or American banks branches outside of US (mostly in Europe), that are not subject to regulation nor reserve requirements. In this regard it is hard to even know exactly the total supply of money in existance ([all-of-the-worlds-money](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/)).

**Trust**<br>
Lately we could observe [breach of trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqGksNRYu8s) in many areas like:<br>
*. [News International phone hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal)<br>
*. [Global Financial Crisis resulted with only 1 banker jailed](https://features.marketplace.org/why-no-ceo-went-jail-after-financial-crisis/)<br>
*. [Volkswagen emmissions scandal](https://hbr.org/2015/09/what-vw-didnt-understand-about-trust)<br>
*. [Panama papers showing rich exploiting ofshore tax regime](https://www.dw.com/en/panama-papers-reveal-how-the-rich-hide-money-offshore/a-19161658)<br>
*. [Corona Covid-19 Pandemic vaccine and lockdown policy](https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/5/e008684)<br>
Obivously institutional trust (legacy systems) is no longer working, because it was not designed for digital age.<br>
Trust is a confident relationship with the unknown, a social glue that bridges the gap:<br>

| [<ins>Known</ins>] <---> TRUST <---> [<ins>Unknow</ins>] |
| ----- |
|       |

It's a currency of interactions. The way to build more trust is to be more transparent and in time you become trustworthy (have reputation capital).<br>

| Trust | INSTITUTIONAL | DISTRIBUTED   |
| -     | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1     | Opaqe         | Transparent   |
| 2     | Closed        | Inclusive     |
| 3     | Centralized   | Decentralized |
| 4     | Licensed      | Accountable   |
| 5     | Top-down      | Bottom-up     |

### To sum it so far [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #to-sum-it-so-far }
-- Countries have entire control of money, and can inflate it for different reasons with various economic tools. That power is then often misused by political elites and corporations while chasing profits (somewhat greedy), that result in higher or in some cases even hyperinflation. This sort of inflation's Moral Hazard is practically an additional hidden/silent (regressive) Tax on population, one could argue theft in a sense, or financial robbery. It is slowly siphoning wealth from the average person to the politically well-connected. And while prices of all goods just increase, salaries do not always grow to keep up, instead workes have to explicitly asks it from employers. So small wage raise does not mean more purchase power, it's just to keep up with inflation.<br>
(*"Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation"* - M. Friedman)<br>
-- State Institutions usually measure Inflation as scalar, just 1 number, [CPI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp) (Consumer Price Index) that includes only basket of basic goods. In practice it is actually a vector because not evebody buys, needs, and wants the same things, so essentially index is mostly fake. Besides just surviving in real world people also desire real estete, traveling, stocks, arts, etc. Instead of just targeted [2 % percents](https://qz.com/2022696/where-did-the-feds-2-percent-inflation-target-come-from/) according to CPI, true inflation was in around 6 to 7 %. And lately even by [CPI is 10%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/17/uk-cpi-inflation-july-2022.html) or more. It's good to learn the **%** Percentage and Interest calculation, in line with quote: *"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world
He who understands it, earns it, he who doesn't, pays it."*, that is offen attributed to Albert Einstein but no evidence he said it. In entire [history of interese rates](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-history-of-interest-rates-over-670-years/) during 6 centuries, it fluctuated from 0 to 15 %, with dominion first of Dutch, then British, and eventually USA.<br>
-- Until recently stock markets were one way to hedge against inflation, but that was also just for small minority (only around 10% of people have significant saving in stock). Currently Crypto Coins - digital tokens, BTC more precisely, are seen as another way of protection (antidote against chaos), and better in certain aspects. Also, it is time consuming to follow all information regarding stock markets and regular people can hardly keep up with various financial instrument used by professional investors.<br>
-- Gold was another safe haven, and some are still proponents of it, so called 'gold bugs', despite its imperfect features. In the 2000s there were even electronic gold systems, like '[e-gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold)' but they were centralized and eventually banned by the government. That's why BTC is considered to be **Digital Gold** or **Gold 2.0** as it has many good features of Gold but at the same time fixes the bad ones. So Bitcoin was <ins> inovative **SOLUTION** to problem</ins> how to have **Hard or Sound money** that can not be overprinted and is also practical to use. It was programmed to mimic gold’s stable inflation rate. Just like gold does not change much the network should also run the same for several decades.<br> 
-- Acknowledged austrian economist [**Ludwig von Mises**](https://mises.org/profile/ludwig-von-mises) in his book *"The Theory of Money and Credit" (1912)* argued that [**Sound money**](https://oll.libertyfund.org/quote/ludwig-von-mises-argues-that-sound-money-is-an-instrument-for-the-protection-of-civil-liberties-and-a-means-of-limiting-government-power-1912) is: *"an instrument for the protection of civil liberties and a means of limiting government power, also a commonly used medium of exchange and  a method for obstructing the government’s propensity to meddle with the currency system.*" More detailed explanation can be found in the article [Bitcoin and the Theory of Money](https://mises.org/wire/bitcoin-and-theory-money).<br>

-- Another issue is the censorship that governments and banks can enforce. We could observe this happened in some Autocratic or Authoritarian countries for opposition but also in democratic ones. For example [Canadian truckers](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/frozen-bitcoin-tied-to-canadian-protests-lands-at-coinbase-crypto.com) whose bank account were frozen for protesting against pandemic lockdown, a 'PC' (Political Correct) way to silent the opposition. **Cryptocurrency** solves this one as well since it can work without intermediary (trustless) and does not require a trusted party (***Money should Not be weaponized, ever!***). Additionally, it allows seamless transactions across borders. With Liberal world view and partly [Libertarian philosophy](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/04/crypto-is-the-libertarian-cheat-code-in-the-final-battle-over-state-coercion/) (eliminate state coercion) part of it's mission is **separation of money and state**. We shell never have decent money before we take monopoly of it await from goverment (make goverment smaller and people bigger).<br>
-- Management of Money and Interventions by the state in most cases was done the wrong way, and even those with good intentions often had bad results:<br>
  &nbsp; (*"The Goverment solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem"* - M. Friedman)<br>
*. Attempt to do good, imperfectly, and often creates more damage than good in pursuit of it<br>
*. When pay for it with inflation it unintentional collapses the currency<br>
*. Mismeasure the extend of monetary policy while underestimate the cost<br>

## 3. How did it all start? [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #how-did-it-all-start }
-- With the beginning of the Internet, information sharing via forums and mails also enabled global spread of ideas. Important movement in this regard was *[Crypto-anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism)* as a political ideology ([ideological origin](https://fee.org/articles/the-ideological-origins-of-bitcoin/)) focusing on protection of privacy, political and economic freedom.<br>
-- ['*The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto*'](https://libinst.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/havel.pdf) was one of the first written papers that articulated this idea, written by [*Timothy C. May*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/authors/timothy-c-may/) in 1988 and shared at a Crypto conference ('*[Arise, you have nothing to lose..](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html)*'). Document introduced the basic principles of crypto-anarchism, encrypted exchanges ensuring total anonymity ([Privacy manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)), absolute freedom of speech, and full freedom to trade. Later in 1992 a specific mail group called **'*Cypherpunks Mailing List*'** was started and by 1994 had around 1000 subscribers. They were considering using cryptography to make digital (virtual) **Decentralized** money.<br>
-- US Intelligence services like NSA (*National Security Agency*), because of their spying programs, even tried to limit use and export of cryptography tools - [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars), that privacy advocates opposed with Free speech rights.<br>
-- Just like there were torrent (data stream) networks for P2P Peer-to-Peer file sharing (music, films e.g. [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster), [BitTorent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)) this was imagined to be a network for digital value. There is also browser for privacy called [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/download/) abbreviation from [The Onion Rooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)).<br>
-- 2 famous economists, both Nobel laureate, even predicted the rise of Bitcoin:<br>
1. [**Friedrich A. Hayek**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek) in his Book *['The Denationalization of Money'*](https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/the-economist-who-predicted-bitcoin) (1976)* argued for the end of the government’s monopoly on currency, and in one [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYhEDxFwFRU&t=1118s) (first 3 min) in 1984 said:<br>
*"Govs mostly abuse money and have stop its improvement, also Monetary policy has done only harm. We can’t take it violently out of the hands of government. All we can do is by some sly, roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop."*<br>
-He was proponent of [Austrian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School) of economic thought (more free market, less government control).<br>
-On the [opposing pole](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/business/keynes-hayek-views-origins-of-an-economics-debate-review.html) was [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes) ho was flag bearer of vigorous government intervention in the markets. His view were widely followed throughout
 the 20th century by many countries ([keynesian economy](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/09/basics.htm)).<br>
2. [**Milton Friedman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) in 1999 [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2mdYX1nF_Y):<br>
*"Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that's missing, that will soon be developed, is the reliable e-cache"*.<br>

-- Relevant person also to mention here is *Nick Szabo*, a computer engineer, cryptographer and legal scholar (American of Hungarian origin). In 1998 he designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called ***'BitGold'***. It was never implemented but has been called *"a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture"* since it was one of the earliest attempts at creating a decentralized virtual currency. In the *Bit Gold* architecture, a participant would dedicate computer power to solving cryptographic puzzles. He is also credited with pioneering the concept of **Smart Contracts**.<br>
-- Near the end of 2008 an anonymous person under the pseudonym of ***Satoshi Nakamoto*** published a White Paper named: [**BITCOIN: A Peer-To-Peer E-Cache System**](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) he designed. Definition of term **White Paper**: a report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. The Paper itself references several other works written in decades before it, and it was first sent to the cypher mailing list.<br>

-- At the same time domain '[*bitcoin.org*](https://bitcoin.org/)' was registered through '[*anonymousspeech.com*](https://www.businessinsider.com/swiss-software-developer-bitcoin-2014-4)' using a prepaid card that can be bought with cash at any local store so it is untraceable. Decision to use an alias and hide his identity was done in order to be unknown to the government but also probably to keep the network decentralized, meaning there is no single founder. Majority of people involved consider not having a leader to be a feature, not a bug, since the main purpose of the network is to be decentralized.<br>
--In 2009 a post on the P2P foundation forum was written with additional explanation of the system. In the same year an **[Open Source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source)** implementation of the protocol was made, written in [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp) programming language, and source code is currently hosted on **[GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)** code repository. These events unfolded just after the 2008 Economic Crisis, which seems to be the trigger. In first/genesis block there is encoded reference to London Times magazine article:<br>
*"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".*<br>

-- Receiver of the first BTC transaction and early contributor to the network was a computer scientist named *Hal Finney*. He was an American developer who worked for **[PGP](https://www.openpgp.org)** (*Pretty Good Privacy*) - first free implementations of public-private key encryption. He also ran the first cryptographically-based anonymous remailer and was involved with the cypherpunks mailing list. Other cryptographers and programmers whose work was cited in the BTC paper were *Wei Dai* (***[B-money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bmoney.asp)***) and British *Adam Back* (***[Hashcash](http://www.hashcash.org/)***) who today is CEO of **[Blockstream](https://blockstream.com)**. All four of them were part of the cypherpunks community and members of the mail list, but also early contributors to the Bitcoin project.<br>
-- So Satoshi could be any of them or someone else, maybe even more than one person, small team. It might always [remain a mystery](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/quien-ha-creado-bitcoin/) but in the end it doesn't matter, the important thing is the result and the network itself. Initial improvements to the first website were done by *[Martti Malmi](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/who-is-martti-malmi/)*, a [student from Finland](https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/10/8751933/the-shy-college-student-who-helped-build-bitcoin-into-a-global).
In the following years several persons were incorrectly suspected or falsely claimed to be Satoshi.<br>
-- Creator of BTC Satoshi, at the end of 2010, made the last post that stated: *There is more work to be done...*. and since then he has not made any known contact. Today we see that the project continued, and it became a world-changing product. In the meanwhile, contributor *Gavin Andresen* became the lead developer till 2014 when *Wladimir van der Laan* from Amsterdam took over.<br>
-- One peculiar note: First real-world Btc transaction was in May of 2010 for two large pizzas that were paid 10 000 BTC (consider current value of those - hundreds of millions $)<br>

## 4. Technical background [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #technical-background }
-- From an engineering aspect Bitcoin protocol is a masterpiece software. We could see that the idea has been circulating for some time and several components of it already existed. But nevertheless integrating it all into a functional unity was done ingeniously. Hats down to Satoshi whoever he / she or they be, for the first full implementation of the idea, while being a visionary. Also, the timing was just right. Firstly the internet and cryptography was sufficiently developed. Secondly the political and economic situation was fertile as well, inspiration came from revolt. Also to define a word **Bit** (binary digit) - the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store, whose value can be 0 or 1. <br>
-- Let's jump to the point:<br>
Bitcoin has a **Ledger** of transactions, which is a list stored in a database that is not centralized in one server but distributed on multiple computers called **Nodes** around the world. Ledger essentially enables reliable spreadsheet with Balances. It's like immutable record that can't be counterfeited. New transactions, up to 2000 of them, are on average every 10 minutes grouped into a **Block** 1 MB in size that is added to the ledger. Each block is connected to previous ones by hash code that is not easy to find. That's why this structure is called **Blockchain**, multiple blocks connected in a line, and it's what underpins the system.<br>
![Blockchain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisdj/borisdj.github.io/master/assets/images/revolution-of-money/blockchain.jpg)

| № | PROPERTIES of| BLOCKCHAIN (type of DLT - Distributed Ledger Technology)              |
| - | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Programmable | i.e. Smart Contracts                                                  |
| 2 | Secure       | all records are individually encrypted                                |
| 3 | Anonymous    | the identity of participants anonymous, either is fully or pseudo     |
| 4 | Unanimous    | all network participants agree to the validity of each of the records |
| 5 | Distributed  | all participants have a copy of the ledger for complete transparency  |
| 6 | Immutable    | any validated records are irreversible and cannot be changed          |
| 7 | Time-stamped | a transaction timestamp is recorded on a block                        |

From functional viewpoint is can be defined as the Great Chain of being sure about things.
3 pillars of blockchain technology are: Decentralization, Transparency (Auditability), Immutability.

-- **[Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)** is a cryptographic function that converts longer text into a relatively unique code of fixed length but reverse can not be done in any practical time. This characteristic is used to do the so-called **Mining**, virtual one of course, a term taken from the gold industry. That work consists of trying an enormous number of combinations to find one where hash begins with several leading zeros 0. Some like to draw analogy with [Sudoka puzzle](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@abhi3700/crypto-thoughts-ct-5-bitcoin-mining-analogy-sudoku-puzzle). All miners are competing to find it and when one does then a new block is finished, synced across the network, and he also gets the reward of a certain amount of newly created coins.<br>
--In the long term based on statistics, every miner should get approximately equal sum, while on the other side they have spent electric power. Based on the number of participants, the algorithm adjusts the difficulty level to keep it always around 10 minutes. It's done in a way that when there are more miners leading to more hash power difficulty increases which makes it harder to find a solution. This process is called **PoW *(Proof Of Work)***, the term is self-explanatory, that consists of defined rules. The **[Nakamoto Consensus](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/nakamoto-consensus-21cd304f96ff)** is a set of rules that verifies the authenticity of a blockchain network. It is using a combination of the proof-of-work [consensus algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-the-nakamoto-consensus) on a **[BFT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerancepbft)** peer-to-peer network (BFT - *Byzantine Fault Tolerance* that solves *Byzantine Generals Problem* a situation in which majority of actors must agree on a coordinated strategy).<br>
-- Another important thing to mention is **[PKI](https://www.keyfactor.com/resources/what-is-pki)** (*Public Key Infrastructure*), which is used here to sign digital info with a private key so others can confirm the signature using the public key, usually packed into a **Digital Certificate**. It ensures that no one can spend coins not belonging to them if they do not have the code aka private key. PKI is usually using [***RSA* algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/) which is based on mathematical inability for large number factorization, to effectively find Prime factors. RSA can be used for digital encryption (hidden data) or for digital signature (ensures data integrity, authentication and non-repudiation). Others algorithms include *Diffie-Hellman* and *Elliptic curve* ([discrete logarithm problem](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220784858_The_Elliptic_Curve_Discrete_Logarithm_Problem_State_of_the_Art)).<br>
![PKI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisdj/borisdj.github.io/master/assets/images/revolution-of-money/pki.png)

-- Combination of these elements makes entire process quite intriguing and at the same time gives several positive consequences:<br>
&nbsp; 1) Prevents double spending - Digital Scarcity for the first time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (original in virtual realm that could not be copied)<br>
&nbsp; 2) Guaranties integrity and security<br>
&nbsp; 3) Gives proper economic incentives to people using and maintaining the network<br>
It also makes good distribution throughout time with descending inflation, since reward generated with mining is halved every 4 years. Maximum number of coins is limited to **[21 million]([https://decrypt.co/34876/why-is-bitcoins-supply-limit-set-to-21-million](https://decrypt.co/34876/why-is-bitcoins-supply-limit-set-to-21-million))** that would be reached in **year 2140** according to estimates. Currently, in 2022 almost 19 million is already created, about 90%. When reward of new coins shrinks, transaction fee will remain for the miners. Some coins in early adoption period were lost due to owners losing key and Satoshi mined almost 1 million coins that were never moved from initial address. One estimate is that owners have misplaced about 20% of all existing tokens, which makes it even more scarce. Some have been wondering why specific amount of 21 million exactly was chosen for max number. The nominal quantity is not that important as long as it is defined and fixed. Reason being it is divisible, currently up to 8 decimals, and 1 BTC have 100 million satoshis (sats) as smallest fraction (up to 8 decimal places).<br>

-- Everybody should be aware that bitcoin is not anonymous, instead it is *Pseudo-Anonymous*, meaning transaction is public but it only has owner number. However if someone ever connects that number to a person then it can be tracked. Ways to avoid being tracked are mentioned in paragraphs bellow.<br>
-- Coins can be stored offline in a digital Wallet or on an exchange. Wallet is a password protected application on mobile or computer, with recovery secret code stored at another location in digital manner or written on paper. It enables full **Self Custody**, in accordance with expression: ***Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins!*** One should not be escaping responsibility, so Take custody of your coins.<br>

## 5. Extended explanation of Bitcoin [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #extended-explanation-of-bitcoin }
As a new internet protocol it enables transfer of value over communication channel. Other earlier application protocols include *https* (web page), *ftp* (file), *smtp* (mail), etc. With latest you can basically send gold coin like mail, any amount of value to anywhere in the world almost instantly. Without anyone being able to stop it or have control, it is **Censorship Resistant** and can't be easily confiscated.<br>
This is first case where Greed and Altruistic incentives aligns. You can now make most selfish decision and also contribute to greater equality in the world. As such it is very useful technological innovation that enables distributed consensus but can also be looked at from various angles. When trying to fully understand it one need to grasp its ***multitude of aspects*** (interdisciplinary):<br>
&nbsp;1) **Economic** (Monetary policy) - predefined and limited quantity (relatively fixed supply)<br>
&nbsp;2) **Technical** (Networking) - decentralization<br>
&nbsp;3) **Political** - reducing state monetary control<br>
&nbsp;4) **Ideological** - core value,<br>
&nbsp;5) **Social**<br>

[Bitcoin Governance](https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/bitcoin-governance/release/2) is similar to 3-pronged (traditional) branches of Government<br> 
([The Three Branches of Blockchain Governance](https://medium.com/digitalassetresearch/the-three-branches-of-blockchain-governance-75a29bf98880))

| № | **GOV**     | **BIT**         | Description                   |
| - | ----------- | --------------- |------------------------------ |
| 1 | Executive   | Full Nodes      | can veto miners               |
| 2 | Judicial    | Miners          | can veto devs                 |
| 3 | Legislative | Core Developers | can help others bypass vetoes |

-- Legislative part also include bussines and infrastructure analogous to Parliament (Representatives) while Devs are like Senat. <br>
-- If compared to enterprises best parallels can be drawn with IT (Information Technology) companies.<br>
Product is global monetary currency and payment system and at the same time the Coin represents owners or share holders.<br>
On the other side Developers and Miners, along with Nodes, and very wide Board of Directors, Management and Supervisory.<br>

**The Rules of Bitcoin:**<br>
&nbsp;1) No Confiscation<br>
&nbsp;2) No Censorship<br>
&nbsp;3) No Inflation<br>
&nbsp;4) Anyone can verify rules 1-3<br>
These rules are derived from protocol characteristic that make it exist in a **narrow design space**, its little niche. Delicate balance mean that even a small alteration to one of coded parameters  can break some other important feature significantly. It can be compared to gravitational constant that is limited to narrow band, where even a slight change would destroy entire universe. This explains some critics about development going slowly. There is not much room for core changes, only fine tunning improvements and building on top of it. There have been push to force some risky core changes but those attempts failed - [**Block Size Wars**](https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained).
One of proposal was to simply increase the size of Block to 2, 4 or even 8 MB, which was rejected because it does not solve long term scalability for entire world. At same time it had bad effects on decentralization because would drastically increase node memory requirements.
On the other hand updates that passed like [SegWit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp#toc-what-is-segregated-witness-segwit) (Segregated Witness) and [Taproot](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/a-beginners-guide-to-the-bitcoin-taproot-upgrade) (with [Schnorr signature](https://cointelegraph.com/news/unpacking-schnorr-signatures-blockstreams-musig-to-improve-bitcoin-transactions)) were more in line with the vision and brought only improvements making it faster, more efficient and private. But they first had to be developed and then 95% of miners (an overwhelming majority) needed to signal support for those to activate it. They are called [BIP](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-improvement-proposals-bips-and-how-do-they-work) ([Bitcoin Improvement Proposal](https://river.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip/)).<br>

-Bitcoin as a whole represents a [Paradigm shift](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-is-the-ultimate-paradigm-shift-2021-10-02) for [Embodiment of capital](https://www.barrons.com/articles/cryptocurrency-and-the-21st-century-paradigm-shift-51635556355) that changed each century:<br>
18th - farmland (agricultural age)<br>
19th - factories, machines, bods (industrial age)<br>
20th - urban real estate, stocks (information age)<br>
21th - virtual asset (digital & distributed age)

### Other Cryptos [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #other-cryptos }
-- When compared to Others crypto coins, important differences are that **BTC** have [**First Mover**](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/first-mover-advantage/) advantage ([the Half-Truth](https://hbr.org/2005/04/the-half-truth-of-first-mover-advantage)), so is most known and almost everybody already heard about it. Then it has no leader per se so has higher decentralization and it was **never hacked**. Still this does not mean that all others are worthless, some of them have valuable additional features. Only those that are not in the same domain as BTC and  target totally different use case, anything else expect base treasury asset, can survive. Of course there were, are, and will be, a lot of those that are more or less a scam. Then there is crap group with stupid idea. Both are in a so-called 'shit' coins category. What remains is small number that could have useful purpose but even many of those will fail because of poor implementation. Just a handful will survive and thrive and maybe become leader in some domain. Still BTC is at the moment only one that has real chance of becoming global monetary system.<br>
-- There are several reasons why it is main One, crypto King, which includes:<br>
&nbsp;1) True Decentralization - main innovation that only BTC has for real.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is of greatest importance and PoW with all its electricity consumption gives it intrinsic worth rooted in physical world and at same time ensures temporal and spatial security (across time and space)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't be counterfeited because it has cost in energy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While companies and their networks/platforms can be censored protocols can not be blocked so easily.<br>
&nbsp;2) Network effect - the more people use it, it's more likely to become bigger (value increases with number of users)<br>
&nbsp;3) Added value with new unique features and functionality<br>
&nbsp;4) Simplistic design in its core and in accordance to IT principle ***[KISS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20262/keep-it-simple-stupid-principle-kiss-principle)*** *(Keep IT Simple, Stupid)*<br>
&nbsp;5) Does only one main function in the base - being just money, but does it very good.<br>

-- Some Altcoins (Alternative coins - any other then Bitcoin) could be viewed as startups where buying those is similar to investing in that company, like some DeFi (Decentralized Finance) application that replicate certain bank services and others. With those investment can often be done with **ICO** (*Initial Coin Offer*), analog to **[IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp)** (*Initial Public Offer*). It's like Dot-com bubble in the 2000s where there many companies that had website but only a few grow to become Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, etc... While many others have completely failed, recent one being Terra-Luna project.<br>
But only BTC is considered (also [by the SEC](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/are-cryptocurrencies-securities-sec-is-answering-question-2022-03-21/)) as **Asset** (other way phrasing it **Digital Property**) while all others cryptos are described as **Securities**.


### SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threat) [[ToC](#toc)] {: #swot-analysis }
Most advantages (SO) it brings are already stated so lets look at certain issues (WT) and their solutions:<br>

**Criticisms** (unsubstantiated):
- The protocol can be copied since it's Open Source
  - Network effect keeps BTC at top, also mining makes it hard to duplicated all hardware and infrastructure
  - There are many copies and forks, both Hard and Soft, but they have little or no value and less liquidity
- Not backed by anything
  - Backed by Electric Power (Intrinsic value from energy)
  - Money as abstract concept partly depends on belief - agreement among people who think it's valuable
- Ponzi scheme (another [Tulip Mania](https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland) Bubble)
  - Is Anti-Ponzi, no pyramidal structure and no percentage for 'bringing' others, everybody freely choose to join
  - Does not 'promise' high nor any returns
  - Had speculative waves but not empty bubble, added value is digital transport of value
- Used for criminal activities
  - Very small percentage of transaction are illegal ones
  - Cash is used for same purposes
  - It is not job of money to worry how it's being used, it's only a tool<br>
    For crimes there is police and special units
- Losing keys(password) or being stollen
  - If want full custody than accept the risk but take all measures of precaution
  - Otherwise keep backup with reliable third parties, option to split keys with multiple subjects (Multisig)
  - Similar is needed with keys storage for Inheritance purposes
  - In the long period people will learn how to keep it safe and will have more options for storage
  - Just like today they keep cash or have a bank account, usually both
- Consumes a lot of electricity, too demanding
  - Using energy is not a bad thing
  - Necessary for security and decentralization
  - Creating money can not be free
  - Incentive is to use cheapest energy, currently mostly from renewables<br>
    also from remote location otherwise unusable and wasted (Geo-independent)
  - Can contribute to stabilizing electric grid by reducing miner consumption on demand in peak times
  - Civilization level of technological advancement is measured by amount of energy able to use ([The Kardashev Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale))
- Distribution fairness?
  - In design it is the fairest system possible Satoshi could have came up at that time
  - Historically Unprecedented experiment in [Fair Distribution](https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892)
  - Has fair-minded issuance mechanism, miners have need to redistribute new coins
  - Incomparably better then centralized ownership
  - Uneven ownership not because of dishonest or unfair feature but due to risk taken by early adopters, supporters, contributors
    even today, when risk is much smaller, many are still afraid to buy into. As they say *He Who Dares Wins!*
  - Had no premining and no initial sale
  - Market dynamics have gradually evened Bitcoin’s distribution and will continue to do so
  - Most equitable cryptoasset in existence

**Existing problems with respective solutions**
- Limited capacity - Inefficient (not scalable enough, currently max around 10 transaction per sec. making them slow and expensive)
  - [Blockchain Trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition) (resilience vs efficiency): /_\ 1.Decentralisation, 2.Security, 3.Scalability
  - Layered structure<br>
    L-1 base layer optimises around Security and Robustness, also keeps it Decentralized<br>
    L-2 improves Scalability segment and enables Fast and Cheap transfers (Lightning Network, Liquid, Side Chains, ...)
- Not fully private, only semi-anonymous / [fungibility](https://mises.org/wire/why-fungibility-important-understanding-money-and-crypto)
  - There are Mixers for getting more privacy while L2 essentially removes individual spendings from main net (not visible)

**Future Risks**
 - Some big unknown bug gets found that breaks the network
   - Not likely since it did not emerge for 13 years and many hackers have tried
   - Code of protocol based on formal Math theorems
 - Total collapse of Internet
   - Highly unlikely with its decentralized nature and all redundancy
   - This would also break current financial system since eBanking, mobileBanking, credit-card, etc. all are using internet services
 - Global long term Power outage / blackout
   - Situation possible only with some apocalyptic event when money would no longer be important
 - Breakthrough in Quantum computers with implementation of [Shor's algorithm](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/shors-algorithm) that could break asymmetric cryptography
   - Not in foreseeable future, and algorithm is just theoretical
   - Also would affect privacy of all current digital systems
   - Already there are ideas for [quantum cryptograhy](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/quantum-cryptography) that would solve the problem

Some Critics would challenge Bitcoin on its Noninflationary nature, a subject that deserves separate paragraph.<br>

### Deflation [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #deflation }
-- It is a decrease / drop in the general price level of goods and services. It occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%.
Often used as as scary word related to Recession and Depression in Economic crisis.<br>
A Deflationary Spiral is a downward price reaction to an economic crisis leading to lower production, lower wages, decreased demand, and falling prices.<br>
-- But [Deflationary economy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u0efbj/you_wouldnt_spend_a_deflationary_currency_bitcoin/) isn’t inherently a recessionary environment at all. In fact, some of the most prosperous times of growth in history were strongly deflationary. As production becomes more efficient it is natural that prices goes down. Also Bitcoin is not formally deflationary, technically it's programmed to be **Disinflationary**, rate of inflation reduces every 4 years. This result in a constant monetary base without changes to the supply.<br>

-- In order to be able to spread BTC, in the beginning it had higher inflation which is reducing over time. So in the long time when everybody owns and use it price would stabilize, prior has to rise a lot, while it gravitates towards zero-inflation. The problem is we live in a system that is completely opposite and based on debt. This debt must get cheaper over time with inflation, because of the opposite were true, all nations and companies default. So the issue isn’t so much deflation per se, it’s the transition from where we are now, being over levered, to a low-inflationary environment.<br>
-- Eventually it would come to equilibrium where value of money would be equal to total Economic Output of world. This allows everybody to have long time horizon and plan on longer period, which is good both for humans and environment. People would buy quality long-lasting stuffs, instead of buying a lot of garbage that would soon be thrown away.  Instead of framing things narrowly, it allows to take a broader view and make better decision.<br>
-- When it comes to wages even if they go down a little bit, price of goods would go down even more making person richer. The difference between nominal and real wages is fundamental. There is no point of rising nominal wages, what matters is net of inflation/deflation.<br>
On the whole **Benefits outweighs the Risks** significantly.<br>

-- For example image a world with global currency that has no inflation. In last 50 years average Economic Growth has been ~ 2%, while for the next 50 years estimates are it could be around 3%. Let us take 2.5% as middle value, and with fixed supply of money it's value should increase each year by 2.5%. In that environment you would not need to rush and spend money, but can take time to think what to buy and where to invest.<br>
-- Regarding credits and loans / borrowing, nominal interest rate would be low but effective one would be nominal + that 2.5%. So credit for House could have nominal rate of 1.5% (4% effective). While investments in business, bearing more risk, would have higher rate of return or probably some share of company.<br>

#### PoW (Proof Of Work - Mining) vs PoS (Proof Of Stake) [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #pow-vs-pos }
-- Proof Of Stake protocols are another class of algorithms for consensus first invented in 2012. They work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost.
Key distinction is that they are not decentralized enough, [quantified](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e) by [**Nakamoto Coefficient**](https://crosstower.com/resources/education/nakamoto-coefficient/), similar to Gini coefficient for inequality measure. PoS does not have incentives in line with it, also distribution is always an issue. So they can only ever be a Security equity (asset issued by body) and not a Commodity.<br>
-- [PoW Efficient](https://danhedl.medium.com/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3) is and in it's nature different and separate, like comparing plain and train. For monetary system PoW is advantages and necessary. Electricity is Bitcoin's physical property.<br>
Hardware that is doing computation for mining initially included home desktops, even laptops, later GPU - Graphics cards, because of multiple coprocessor and eventually custom build server machines called [ASIC](https://zipmex.com/learn/asic-miner/) miner (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). They are much more efficient and have made regular computers obsolete for this purpose. Because of this algorithm has a feature called **Difficulty Adjustment** that is done every 2 weeks. This ensures constant time for block generation of 10 minutes, regardless of processing Hashrate (Th/s). The more power is inputted the more difficult it becomes to find the correct solution. So incentives are to have more miners when price goes up but on the other side halving makes reward smaller, so it has [no scaling issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q769w4/how_does_bitcoins_energy_usage_scale/) and there will be equilibrium established, reward shrinks while value is expected to rise. Additionally miners receive a fixed fee from each transaction. In future Transaction fees will become more important then reward.

### Last decade [[ToC](#toc)]
-- It is nothing less then a miracle that the project the survived and took off. Already 13 years in action and had not stopped for a second. In the first half of last decade it was unknown to wide public, and also unceratin project. Today although still in early phase we can say that the biggest hurdles are behind.
We can identify Crypto ecosystem as new cultural and economic trend that started from forum, spread through Reddit and Twitter. This what created condition under which broader Addoption occured.
-- Internet evolution pure data and communication to social information and digital value. So this next steep of scientific evolution is standing on the shoulders of giants.

### Sociopolitical implications [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #socio-political-implications }
-- Inflating currency supply distorts the money and equals creating more imaginary products which negatively affects the markets.
Central planning (of money also) goes against evolution, one of the reasons it always fails.
[Monetarism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/monetarism) - emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation
Before bitcoin we have never had an incorruptible monetary base layer.
World needs a Neutral (reserve) currency, now more then ever.

Some notable examples of high and hyper inflation since 2000s:<br>
-Hyper: Venezuela (10,000 %), Argentina, Zimbabwe (1,000 %), Gana, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, ...<br>
-High: Argentina(70 %), Russia, Turkey, etc.<br>
-Moderate: USA, UK, EU, and others<br>

-- Since is it hard/impossible to ban bitcoin globaly, countries can ignore it or try to regulate it.
Some laws are more accepting while other have resticting ones.
China has for exampla [ban minning]((https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/what-s-behind-china-s-cryptocurrency-ban/)), as bitcoin can interfere and jeopardize their central infulence on population.
They might be the first to implement [CBDC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp) (Central Bank Digital Currency) which would give even more power to the Surveillance State. This would allow easier spread of [Social Credit System](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4), a distopia everyone should oppose. So Bitcoin can facilitate reduction of government ability to track and monitor its citizens.<br>
-- On the other side more democratic countris have embraced and made it legal but require **KYC** (Know Your Customer) and **AML** (Anti-Money Laundering).
So most exchanges have to be in Compliance with these rules and ask user for Identity documents.
Still there are some DEXs (Decentralized exchanges) that can circumvent these requirements.
-- At the moment countries have different range of [attitudes towards bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/041515/countries-where-bitcoin-legal-illegal.asp). Those more [friendly ones](https://learn.bybit.com/investing/most-crypto-friendly-countries/) have legalised it in a way to be either accepted (US, EU,...), or non taxable (*Portugal* as prominent with [residency](https://rebase.co/portugal) for [Digital Nomads](https://govisafree.com/crypto-portugal/) including ['Bitcoin family'](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/06/bitcoin-family-moves-to-portugal-crypto-tax-haven.html)), or even legal tender ([El Salvador](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/el-salvador-officially-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-but-will-other-countries-follow) first one; [El Zonte](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1086851329/el-salvadors-leader-wants-to-go-in-even-bigger-on-bitcoin) - [Bitcoin Beach](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-beach-el-salvador-60-minutes-2022-04-10/)). On the other side are more sceptical ones still waiting to see where it goes.<br>

-- Btc is hope for many people who are in despair and marginalized. One of use cases is to give freedom to people in countries under some sanction like [Cuba](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/08/you-would-understand-bitcoin-if-you-were-under-cubas-embargo/), Iran, etc. It can also help refugees escape conflict zones and leave (with their saving) from Libya, Russia, Ukraine, Syria, etc. Same is true from those  fleeing oppressive and tyrannical regimes.<bt>
Next to mention many African countries with have very weak (high inflating) currency, in which a lot of people don't have access to finacial services. Some are even using foreign issued post-colonial money, namely [CFA Franc](https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-don-t-like-our-money-the-story-of-the-cfa-and-bitcoin-in-africa) that is still controlled by the French treasury. So Open Source code is [fighting monetary colonialism](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-currency-of-decolonization) as well, as described by Alex Gladstein.

-- It's now obvious that Supremacy of the [Petrodollar Economy is Waning](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/05/28/the-waning-supremacy-of-the-petrodollar-economy/) and its hegemony coming to an end. This will probably lead to decentralised multipolar multi-reserve system.

### Economic impact [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #economic-impact }
BTC gives more Economic freedom, and it makes money *SAVING simple* as it should be.
It brings financial tools to unBanked, underBanked and underServiced world, allowing people to become almost Bankless in traditional sense.
The goal of Bitcoin not to bank the world but to de-bank it.
Important aspect and one of reason why entire project was successful is because of good [**Tokenomics**](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-tokenomics-and-why-is-it-important/) - financial incentives to mine, buy, use and hold tokens.

Worth mentioning are the
Economic Cycles

### Looking into the Future [[ToC](#toc)] {: #looking-into-the-future }
Although it has the power to disrupt Banking and monetary industry we can look at it more as a transformative technology that will improve and augment it. And only time will unlock it's full potential. Firstly it was interesting cool new technology, and later it became something like investment, sort of digital gold - Store of Value.<br>
In the long run idea is for it to become regular everyday payment service, to fully realize function as Medium of Exchange. For this to happen it needs good integration with second layer lightning protocol for scalability. Once it grows large enough it will become stable which enables it tBitcoin Standard,hen to be also Unit of Account. If this happens it will inevitable become Global Reserve Asset, **Bitcoin Standard**, and in many countries as people adopt it, regulatory will follow to make it like foreign currency, meaning no capital gain tax. Since nobody controls it, it is also easier for all countries, including world super powers, to use for international clearing since they will not depend on the competition. In that case it's value could rise to few hundred thousands in several years, even reaching a million in 10+ years.<br>

-- When most countries join the system they will even compete how has better adoption, and eventually their CBs will start acquiring Bitcoin as part of their reserves. Banks will also own Btc as reserve asset.

### What next ? [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #what-next }
First it's important to learn as much and have wide understanding of it all. Since this system is not forced but is **Opt-In** (freely choose to use it / be involved and make better world) just learning about it is already a contribution. Next then comes playing with it and later teaching others around you (it's virtuous to teach people) and to promote it. There is a famous meme (rapidly spread cultural element): **[LaserEyes](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/laser-eyes-crypto)** - significant focus on important thing that can make a difference.<br>
Secondly decide if you want to buy some, for now as an investment and later as a Savings Accounts. This way you will try it yourself and learn a few things Install one or few of recommended wallets, register on exchange, withdraw funds to your wallet.<br>
Regarding the amount, usually there are few advisable options:<br>
&nbsp;1) buy only what you are ready to lose<br>
&nbsp;2) don not sell in bear market when it falls down, instead Hold or HODL (meme variation)<br>
&nbsp;3) consider to start accepting payments in Bitcoin (try lightning wallet)<br>

### Practical Advice [[ToC](#toc)]

Investment Strategy

### Recapitulation [[ToC](#toc)]
{: #recapitulation }
Money systems have changed through history and current one has mayor flaw, it being centralized and having too much power in single place. That inevitable leads to corruption which results in high inflation, so we can say it is broken. Reason it was tolerated is that it was the best that existed at the time. But with new time come new technology that enabled better systems. From Store of Value perspective it should have lowest possible inflation. In this regard Bitcoin is in simple words just better money system and overall good if we apply moral framework to it.<br>
-- Hyperinflation and [currency collapses](https://ginifoundation.org/kb/fiat-currency-graveyard-a-history-of-monetary-folly/) are not exceptionally rare events. In fact, the average lifespan of a fiat currency is only about 35 years, which means these events happen much more frequently than many people realize. When viewed from civilization perspective we want store to last minimum our lifetime, better even longer for inheritance. Also almost half of societal problems arise from money, so fixing the money will fix the world (meme: ***Bitcoin Fixes this!***), in part at least. Remaining issue (ecology, sustainability, health care, etc.) will need their own solutions. Money should be a **Fiduciary** system - legally and ethically bound to act in clients/users best interest and ahead of their own, duty to preserve good faith and trust.<br>
-- Hope that entire story have arouse your curiosity and elevate critical thinking.<br>
