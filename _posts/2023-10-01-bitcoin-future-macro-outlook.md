**Bitcoin** expectations for the coming decades<br> emphasis

Let's start with the notion that behind Bitcoin is an idea, essentially that monetary system should not be controlled by the government. The reason being is that, since it is centralized and countries have monopoly over it, in the long period (50 to 100 years), it gets corrupted. As such it is misused which ends up with currency devaluation(debasement) and high or hyper runaway inflation, as history has shown.  
So the proposal is to break this vicious circle by making decentralized system where no government will be able to print money with a click of a button. Meaning they effectively would no longer have monetary policy, only fiscal. In principle it is not anti-government, just for smaller and more transparent administration. We could say it is a movement towards financial autonomy and freedom.

To be future-proof from changes towards inflationary model it needs high level decentralization which requires real world cost (anchor in physical world), that is manifested in 'mining' as Proof of Work - PoW.  
Some would argue that using 0.3 to 0.6 % of worlds electricity is pretty cheap to have global high-quality monetary system for long term. Even banking industry today uses more power then this.  
Electrical Power production is another issue and in the future all power should be green from sustainable sources.

Bitcoin protocol is just a first functional implementation of this idea (courtesy of Cypherpunks).
(Dis->Non)inflationary neutral and apolitical money (agnostic to politics) as bottom up emergent phenomena.
It was designed and programmed to have best characteristic of Money:  
1. Durable, 2. Divisible, 3. Portable, 4. Acceptable, 5. Scarce, 6. Uniform  
(fixes bad features of gold regarding easy division and transport because of which yellow metal was centralized).

Next to address and elaborate some often given scepticism towards it.

Others 'cryptos' (alt coins) are not real competition to Bitcoin because of:  
First mover advantage, Network effect(value is subjective), Distributed hash rate, biggest community with strong commitment/conviction and ever growing adoption.  
PoS (Proof of Stake) are 'securities' like and do not have real decentralization, no separation of power, and Staking is fundamentally centralizing force. Some of them might find another use case but not as good money.  
Also any real new invention, since all are open source, could be added into Bitcoin with new update. For example Litecoin is somewhat of a Test network for Bitcoin, Lightning feature was first implemented there.
Only Bitcoin is considered as Commodity, even the SEC (Security Exchange Comission) confirmed it as such.

Early adopters are fairly rewarded for the risk and time they invested.

As for the criticism of being slow, it kinda is but for a good reason, or a few of them.
Distributed ledger can have only limited size and growth based on world wide average internet connection and average disk size. Also all worlds transactions do not (and should not) need to be on public ledger. One payment for coffee has no place on permanent database (emphasis on structural efficiency).
So only feasible solution was to limit number transactions/per second on main layer, and solve scalability on top layers. In the future it is expected that base layer would serve for settlement between lightning nodes, custodians, banks, countries, like today is RTGS or GIRO as interbank clearing, or similar to how swift works. So regular transactions would be on Lightning or other Layer 2 (L2) solutions, where it is faster (instant), low cost (1000 cheaper then visa) has bigger capacity (potentially 1 million+ TPS) and more privacy.

Next let me lay out one possible way how we could get to this system. Since BTC is Scarce (Most Important nodes) while Fiat is constantly inflationary, people have INCENTIVE to save as much in Bitcoin.
Proposition here is that it serves as SoV - Store Of Value (digital Gold 2.0) but in longer period.
Later when everybody has some of it, they will start paying and accepting it directly instead of converting it into Fiat, MoE - Medium of Exchange func.
And third phase (if it ever comes to this one) could be when price are in it, so Unit of Account feature (universal currency).
Each phase 1,2,3 could last at least 10 years (free estimate). (prePhase 0 was till recently - accumulations as Collectibles). Similar to internet evolution (1980-2020) with S-Curve growth.
Around 2040-2050 we will know final result (needs generational change), in best case 1 BTC could be million+ $. At that point it would fully stabilize, and until then volatility would be lower each cycle.

Also between countries there is Game Theory dynamics (US, Russia, etc) so even some of them blocking it (aka China) can not stop it, and if few make it legal tender, others would eventually join (FOMO). So this would be free-market chosen hard money, just as history suggest always happens (Thiers law - good money will drive out bad one, on commodity level field). But since it would not be centralized it could keep its max cap permanently (no central point of control to make more - removes the fallible human element). At the end there would be balance with its total monetary units (21 mil Btc * 100 mil = 21 quadrillion Sats) and entire world economy (Hyperbitcoinization).
So it would be like precise measurement system for the value (1 meter unit also does no change even as we have taller buildings).

Few more remarks:
Limited supply would not be fundamentally problem as long as it is divisible downwards.
Hording not an issue, as humans have everyday needs but also wants and would spend and save during their life (nobody lives forever). So there would be an equilibrium at any moment in time (factor Velocity of Money: MV=PT)
No risk of deflationary spiral since that is only possible in MoneyAsDebt system.

Possible effects are:
people would spend more prudently, and would take only calculated risks/credits.
-lower time preference, long-term mindset, less consumerism of junk goods (no overconsumption)
-real wages that keeps purchasing power with mild price deflation (no need to ask for raise just to keep up with inflation) leading to greater prosperity
Some other results:
simplified savings, fair distribution of economy grow (no Cantillon effect), removing silent regressive Tax via inflation.

Credits would be little more expensive then today, since they would have real cost, but it would give correct price signal to market participants. Banks (for loans) would be like in Free Banking, and would need to take care about duration of credits and term deposit. No Central Bank for bailout, no lender of last resort.
Also to note here that fractional reserve banking could still exist, only would be limited with deposits and have upper bound to risk exposure. No more NINJA loans (No Income, No Job, no Assets).
Real estates would have lower price since they would not serve as Store of Value and would lose that monetary premium.

My assessment currently is that Bitcoin has 51% chance of expanding (in 2017 was 30% and in 2013 I gave it 10% then). The longer it exist (15 years so far) the higher are chances of succeeding (Lindy effect).
Like any investment it is a bet, just like any decision in life is. For risky ones, invest only what you are able to lose.
DYOR and make personal probability for each hypothetical scenario.
Along this line there are halving cycles every 4 years.
Reward is reduced by half and because many are doing DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) that should lead to price hike approximately ~ x2.
That then gets media attention which attract new people and traders, leading to hype and new all time high, which is followed by crash and bear market. So it has specific market dynamic but 4 year average is constantly going (logarithmic growth) up and number of adopters increase with each round, usage and mobile apps are getting more user friendly every day. If this logic is correct by the end of 2025 it could peak in range between 100 and 200 K, and then maybe fall back bellow 100, say to 80 K (estimation based on rainbow price chart)
For conclusion: Following months will be interesting to see how this plays out, stay tuned :)
