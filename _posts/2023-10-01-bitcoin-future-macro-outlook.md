### Intro
{: #intro }
Let's start with the notion that behind Bitcoin is an idea, essentially that the monetary system should not be controlled by the government. The reason being is that, since it is centralized and countries have monopoly over it, in the long period (50 to 100 years), it gets corrupted. As such it is misused which ends up with currency devaluation(debasement) and high or hyper runaway inflation, as history often proved. That results in citizens' savings being stolen, capital destroyed and economy broken. In addition it makes easier to wage unjustified wars and fuels populist politicians.  
So the proposal was to break this vicious circle by making a decentralized system where no government will be able to print money with a click of a button. In principle it is not anti-government, just for smaller and more transparent administration with checks and balances. We could say it is a movement towards financial autonomy and freedom.

Bitcoin protocol is just the first functional implementation of this idea (courtesy of Cypherpunks).  
Disinflationary sound money that is internet native, digital, neutral and apolitical (agnostic to politics) as bottom up emergent phenomena.  
Also being fully permissionless and trustless, since people trust is often betrayed by large organisations.  
It was designed and programmed to have best characteristic of Money:  
&nbsp;1. Durable, 2. Divisible, 3. Portable, 4. Acceptable, 5. Scarce, 6. Uniform  
(fixes bad features of gold regarding difficult division and transport because of which yellow metal was centralized).  

### Way Forward
{: #forward }
Next to lay out one possible way we could get to this system. Since BTC is Scarce (most important feature) while Fiat is constantly inflationary, people have INCENTIVE to save as much in Bitcoin.  
Proposition here is that it serves as **SoV** - *Store Of Value* (digital Gold 2.0) in the long period (disregarding short term volatility).  
Later when almost everybody has some of it, they will start paying and accepting it directly instead of converting it into Fiat. And so it slowly takes on the function of **MoE** - *Medium of Exchange*.  
And the third phase (if it ever comes to this one) could be when prices are in it, so **UoA** - ***Unit of Account*** feature (universal currency).  
Each phase 1,2,3 could last at least 10 years (free estimate). (prePhase 0 was till recently - accumulations as Collectibles). Similar to internet evolution (1980-2020) with S-Curve growth.  
After 2030 it will be visible if it is going in this direction and around 2040-2050 we will know the final result (needs generational change). In the best case 1 BTC could be worth million+ $. At that point it would fully stabilize, and until then volatility would be lower each cycle.

Also between countries there is Game Theory dynamics (US, Russia, etc) so even some of them blocking it (aka China) can not stop it, and if few make it legal tender, others would eventually join (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out). So this would be free-market chosen hard money, just as history suggests always happens (Thiers law - good money will drive out bad one, on commodity level field). But since it would not be centralized it would keep its max cap permanently (no central point of control/failure to increase the supply - removes the fallible human element). At the end there would be balance with its total monetary units and the entire world economy (Hyperbitcoinization).
So it would be like a precise measurement system for the value - [measuring stick](https://dematerialize.blog/bitcoin-is-the-economic-measuring-stick){:target="_blank"} (1 meter unit also does not change even as we have taller buildings).

#### Upcoming period
April 2024 is when next havling occurs. Event refers to reducing (by half) creation of new coins that miners receive as reward, and it happens every 4 years in cycles.
Because many are buying regulary and doing DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) it should lead to price hike approximately ~ x2.  
It then gets media attention which attracts new people and traders, leading to hype and new all time high, that is followed by crash and bear market. So it has a specific market behavior but the 4 year average is constantly going up (logarithmic growth) and number of adopters increase with each round. Usage becomes easier as mobile apps are getting more user friendly every day.  
If this logic is correct, from current price of $ 27.000 on 2023/10/01, by the end of 2025 it could peak in range between 100 and 200 thousand USD. After this in 2026 or 2027 maybe it will fall back again to $ 100 K or even little below that (estimation based on rainbow price chart).

**Possible effects:**  
-- people would spend more prudently, and would take only calculated risks/credits  
-- lower time preference, long-term mindset, less consumerism of junk goods (no overconsumption)  
-- real wages that keeps purchasing power with mild price deflation leading to greater prosperity  
&nbsp;&nbsp;(no need to ask for raise just to keep up with inflation)    
-- fair distribution of economy growth by removing silent regressive Tax via inflation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;(no Cantillon effect - those close to printing machine benefit the most),
-- simplified savings  

### Macro analysis (fixed money supply):
{: #macro }  
&nbsp;**1.** It is singular global monetary protocol - Bitcoin Standard (world reserve currency), so no issues with conversion between currencies for global trade.
 
&nbsp;**2.** This would be neutral and apolitical money (somewhat radical idea), so countries effectively would no longer have monetary policy, only fiscal. Economy will have natural business cycles and become be more stable. So swings should be much smaller since they could not artificialy rise as much because there is no government bailout.

&nbsp;**3.** Limited supply would not be fundamentally a problem as long as it is divisible downwards (8 digits + 8 decimal => 21 mil Btc * 100 mil = 21 quadrillion Satoshis or Sats) and lightning even enables miliSats. 
If the world economy grows on average 1% per year, some things would reduce its price by 1% (mild price deflation). Of course few would fall even more if production gets extra efficient and some could rise if there would be extra demand.  
Also there is no risk of deflationary spiral since that is only possible in the MoneyAsDebt system (money created with each new credit while being destroyed when debt is paid off).

&nbsp;**4.** Hoarding is not an issue, as humans have everyday needs but also wants and would spend and save during their life (nobody lives forever).  
So there would be an equilibrium at any moment in time.  

&nbsp;**5.** Credits would be a little more expensive than today, since they would have real cost, but it would give the correct price signal to market participants. Banks (for loans) would be like in Free Banking, and would need to take care about duration of credits and term deposit. No Central Bank as lender of last resort.  
Also to note here that fractional reserve banking could still exist, only would be limited with deposits and have an upper bound to risk exposure. No more NINJA loans (No Income, No Job, no Assets).  
Real estates would have lower prices since they would not serve as a Store of Value and would lose that monetary premium.

### Finally to address and elaborate some often given scepticism towards it:
{: #scepticism }  
&nbsp;**1.** Others 'cryptos' (alt coins) are not real competition to Bitcoin because of:  
First mover advantage, Network effect(value is subjective), best governance model, most decentralized miners hashrate and wide node distribution, biggest community (contributors, developers) with strong commitment/conviction and ever growing adoption from users.  
Those using PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism are 'securities' like and do not have real decentralization, no separation of power, and Staking is fundamentally a centralizing force. Some of them might find another use case but not as good money. Only Bitcoin is considered as Commodity, confirmed as such by the SEC (Security Exchange Commission of the USA).  
Also Side/Drive-chains ([BitVM](https://www.eddieoz.com/bitvm-a-computational-revolution-in-bitcoin/){:target="_blank"}) as second layers could be better then separate Alts since they can tap into Bitcoin L1 base security.  
And any real new invention, since all are open source, could be added into Bitcoin with new updates. For example Litecoin is somewhat of a Test network for Bitcoin, Lightning feature was first implemented there.  

&nbsp;**2.** As for the criticism of being slow, it kinda is but for a good reason, or a few of them.  
Distributed ledger can have only limited size and growth based on world wide average internet connection and average disk size. Also all world transactions do not (and should not) need to be on public ledger. One payment for coffee has no place on a permanent database (emphasis on structural efficiency). It it trilemma between Decentralisation, Security and Scalability.  
So the only feasible solution was to limit number transactions per second on the main layer, and solve scalability on top layers. In the future it is expected that the base layer would serve as a settlement between lightning nodes, custodians and banks with published proof of reserves, countries, etc; like today RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) or GIRO as interbank clearing, or similar to how swift works. So regular transactions would be on [Lightning](https://medium.com/blockchain/the-lightning-network-explained-f3982356f87e){:target="_blank"} or other Layer 2 (L2) solutions, where it is faster (instant), low cost (1000 cheaper than visa), has bigger capacity (potentially [1 million+ TPS](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-vs-visa-and-mastercard-how-do-they-stack-up){:target="_blank"}) and more privacy.  
Interesting note to mention here is that on top of lightning rails we could see implementation of [StableSats](https://www.eddieoz.com/bitvm-a-computational-revolution-in-bitcoin/){:target="_blank"} used instead of centralized stable coins USDT/USDC, until the Bitcoin Sats themselves become stable enough.

&nbsp;**3.** To be future-proof from changes towards the inflationary model it needs high level decentralization which requires real world cost (anchor in physical reality). That is manifested in 'mining' as Proof of Work - PoW.  
Regarding this power consumption, the argument is that using 0.3 to 0.6 % of the world's electricity is pretty cheap to have a global high-quality monetary system for the long term. Even the banking industry today has higher power expenditure than this.  
At the same time miners can help stabilize the grid and also it can consume stranded energy.
Electrical production is another issue and in the future all power should be green from sustainable sources.

&nbsp;**4.** On the issue of fair distribution, early adopters are fairly rewarded for the risk and time they invested. And also for having nerves of steel to hold for long through turbulent times, because without them the system could not have succeeded.

### Conclusion
{: #conclusion }
Personal assessment currently is that Bitcoin has 51% chance of growing and expanding  
(in 2017 was 30% and in 2013 maybe 10% then).  
The longer it exists (15 years so far) the higher are chances of succeeding (Lindy effect).  
Like any investment it is a bet, as any decision in life is.  
For risky ones, invest only what you can afford to lose.  
DYOR and make your probability for each hypothetical scenario.

Epilogue: Following months will be interesting to see how this plays out, stay tuned.
