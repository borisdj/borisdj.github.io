### Intro
{: #intro }
Let's start with the notion that behind Bitcoin (**BTC**) is an Idea, essentially that the monetary system should not be controlled by the government. The reason being is that, since it is centralized and countries have monopoly over it, in the long period (50 to 100 years), it gets corrupted. As such, it is misused which ends up with currency devaluation and high or hyper runaway inflation, as history often proved. That results in citizens' savings being stolen, capital destroyed and economy broken. In addition, makes it easier to wage unjustified wars, fuels populist politicians, and at the same time increases wealth gap.
So the proposal was to break this vicious circle by making a decentralized system where no government will be able to print money with a click of a button (**The separation of money and state**). Similarly, Gutenberg printing press contributed to separation of church and state by making books widely available (it democratized knowledge).  
Money is an abstract concept and a proxy for time, the most valuable human resource. And people don't want more money, but what they can buy with it.  

Epilogue: Following months will be interesting to see how this plays out, stay tuned.
